I'd had no inclination to buy another Kindle, because the touch screen wasn't enough of a pull to spend more money on it. I had filled my 2010 Kindle with 18 pages of books and felt sad that I couldn't read it in the bath (my second favourite place) or at night in bed with the light off (my favourite place) I looked on the Amazon store to see how much the Kindle Paperwhite was, and saw this beauty!Wow is all I can say! Amazon seemed to have packed everything you could possibly want into this Kindle Paperwhite! It's small and compact (see pictures), it has light control, it's waterproof, AND you can listen to Audible - all for £129.99! I was definitely sold from the word go!I received it today and I have had a little play around with it and here's what I really like!ProsThe new Kindle has no buttons around the edge and it's easy to grasp and keep ahold of.It has Audible and is waterproof like the Kindle Oasis but at a fraction of the priceThere are no fiddly buttons to change the page but instead a touch screen (very different to my Kindle 2010)There isn't a frame that sits above the screen on this Kindle which makes it look lovely and fancyThere is a major amount of space compared to the Kindle I had (I have the 8gb which fits in all of my books and there is still more space)You can set font profiles so if others are using it, it will alter to their preference with easeConsThe only possible con I can think of is I am going to have no time to sleep or socialise because I am going to be stuck reading on this.Overall Amazon have done an amazing job with this new Kindle Paperwhite and at a fraction of the cost of the other high-end Kindles it sells.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"13 November 2018","ReviewerName":"robert slade","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    read the small print!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Upgraded to this paper white as the previous one died on me. Unlike the last one the sleep screen on this is used by amazon to bombard me with advertisements for crap.Probably more a software thing than a device one, and the device itself works ok. But having spent £130 basically to replace a device I’ve gained nothing of use to me and a bunch of invasive advertising with no option to shut it off. My new kindle is basically inferior to the old one due to Amazons marketing. It’s making me less inclined to spend money with Amazon.UPDATE:Turns out I had bought an ‘advertisement enabled’ Kindle which gives you a ten pound discount in exchange for all the adverts. That wasn’t at all clear, - it’s in the small print of the description - and I would have gone with the more expensive option had it been obvious there were two options.Amazon had kindly responded to my initial one star review and removed the ads from the Kindle. Credit where credit is due, great customer service.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"12 November 2018","ReviewerName":"JR Harvey","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A great upgrade from the \"keyboard\" for me\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    My old kindle \"keyboard\" finally gave up the ghost after daily use for 8 years, and while I was a little reluctant to change, for reading in bed so as not to disturb my wife earlier this year I tried the paperwhite; I liked it but had to return two of these as the screen wasn't evenly lit and the battery was awful; I took a refund and I went back to my keyboard.However this new paperwhite seems excellent (I've it less than a week). I particularly like the smooth screen (no more bits of dirt getting trapped in the bezel) and the fact it is water resistant. It feels a premium product despite the cost and despite being mainly plastic.I purchased one of Amazon's dedicated covers and this wakes and sleeps the kindle as would a tablet. It's so much smaller and lighter then the \"keyboard\" I had although as it is touchscreen by necessity you require more touches than on the keyboard to do anything. It's very responsive though and not hard to learn.It's been said in other reviews of the older paperwhite, but I miss the neatness of how the \"keyboard\" treated collections. You can still move a book to a collection, but it stays on the home screen rather than being \"filed\" away.Overall I have upgraded fairly seamlessly and any gripes are small, compared to the clarity of the screen and ease of adjusting the settings (brightness, fonts etc). So far, the battery seems to be about 75%, and this is following one initial charge, lots of set up, downloading and playing around with settings. And some reading too!!Overall a great job rom Amazon, and 5 starts follows if they can sort out their clunky collections function.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"18 November 2018","ReviewerName":"HonestReview","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good Little Reader, but pricey for what it is.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    So this is my first ever Kindle, I won't lie I'm not the sort of person to read much, other than the usual fake news on the web, and 100's of emails at work, I digress.I was on a pre-release, list for this item, I was excited to get it first hand. The packaging was ok, although the USB cable wasn't tied with any nice plastic sleeve, it was just shoved in at the bottom. Sure it was new but still the way items are packaged fare well with me.  The device works ok, its a reader so not much to say, Hate the fact its automatically blasts you with new offers.  I probably should of gone for the 8GB as I still have 27GB left and I don't like reading multiple books as once.For what it is, which is a silicon cover with a fancy screen doesn't really warrant £149? the transition between pages is not smooth in my opinion, as if it needs a better CPU.. Haven't tested the water resistant,s other than wiping it before I placed it in my cover. Or tested the audible capability yet.In regards to accessories, don't spend £34 on a cover from Amazon, please visit ebay, I got a tidy cover for £6.55, fits perfect and wakes it up and puts it to sleep.Overall a good device but again, you can pickup an Amazon Fire for £30 and download the kindle app?Or you can get a Huwai Tablet for £159  and have it in colour, including games tablet and more.I guess the real benefit of this device is the battery power 6 weeks apparently! had mine on for 2 now, and only moved a little bit\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"20 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Dave QA ","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Another rushed product, sent out before efficient testing.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    So I very recently purchased a refurb 7th gen kindle paperwhite. I think it's an amazing bit of kit, wish I had got one years ago. It feels great to hold, appears to be durable. The screen feels like I'm reading from a page of an old book when I dim the brightness. (about halfway)The new kindle came out, with more bells and whistles, so I purchased this knowing I could return my refurb one. Not that anything was wrong, just the newer one would be better.. Right? WRONG.So I should start by saying, I did quality assurance for broadcasting, testing the equipment and more importantly the video output. So I'm straight up fussy quality assurance engineer.The new kindle is very light, and very plastic.. It's an uchi fi feeling in your hand. Asif you've just purchased a cheap Chinese knock off. Does not give me confidence in its durability at all. Aswell as lack of surface grip on the back.My biggest problem is the lightning. Its extremely radiant fluorescent. In other words, fake.. It totally takes away the authentic feeling of reading from a book. It's actually alot similar to a kindle fire tablet, without the glare. Though with a fire tablet, you're able to put blue shade on, which actually makes it more authentic than the new paperwhite kindle.The image quality appears to have dropped too. Now I'm comparing the exact same small image on both kindle paperwhites, the latest has lower quality edges. This could be due to the lighting, as the black colour is more faded. Could also be due to different software..The last thing, and this is purely personal preference; the white  \"Kindle\" logo at the bottom of the paperwhite. This gripes me. There's nothing worse than having a logo so obvious in your eyesight. It's as bad as having a over empowering watermark on video. Every page you read will end in Kindle.I was reluctant to replace a book with technology, but the kindle 7th gen made this transition alot easier with its authentic look of pages. I will be keeping it and returning the latest.The picture I attached, will appear to show a much sharper latest kindle (on right), this is due to the back light. My camera was not set up for the white balance (I really wasn't going to go into this depth) but what it does demonstrate, is the 7th gen having a more authentic book look.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"20 November 2018","ReviewerName":"\n      \n        Siltone\n      \n        TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE\n    ","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    An early Xmas present - to myself!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Some years ago, I bought one of the early Kindles but have to confess that I never really used it on a regular basis. I found its operation rather clunky and the absence of a back-light was a real hindrance. Eventually, I started to read kindle books via the Kindle app on my iPhone 5, the big draw back obviously being the size of the screen - so lots and lots of screen-swiping! Anyhow, having got used to reading books electronically, I thought I'd check out the latest Kindles and see if it was worth buying one. I was drawn to the features available on the All-new Kindle Paperwhite - and I was equally impressed by all the rave reviews. So, I took the plunge and bought one. Am I happy with my purchase - you bet I am!My new Kindle came within four days of placing the order, and it was nicely boxed up in protective packaging. Inside, I found a Kindle, USB lead, and a small booklet (regarding the warranty and how to take care of the device). One of my concerns (and I know others have expressed this) was whether or not my existing library (154 books) would be difficult to access via the new Kindle - I needn't have worried though because the whole procedure to achieve this was easy-peasy. Straight out of the box, I switched on the Kindle to find that the battery had around 50% of power. I then waited a few seconds before following the on-screen set-up instructions - even for me, this was child's play. There were a few requests that I skipped (like wishing to link in with social media or to get latest book info from Goodreads). I then had to choose a wi-fi network from the drop-down box, followed by filling in my network password. I'd say that within three minutes I was up and running and all of my 154 books were sitting there on the screen. After acquainting myself with the menus etc, I switched off the device and placed it on charge (yellow/orange light displayed). Within the hour it was fully charged (green light displayed). So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed using this Kindle.I paid the extra £10 to get 'without special offers' - if you don't want irritating pop-up ads interfering with your reading enjoyment then I would advise you to do likewise. I haven't tested the waterproof capabilities of this device as I don't intend to use it whilst in the bath or in the swimming pool. However, I may occasionally place it inside my backpack when out hiking - so it's reassuring to know that if I'm in a down-pour, the odd drop of water won't harm it. It's obviously wise to protect your device, so I have mine secured in a Fintie Slimshell Case made of Lightweight (100g) PU leather, Amazon sell these for around £15. I believe they're available in 16 different designs - mine is the Z- Galaxy one which I think looks rather cool......\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"12 December 2018","ReviewerName":"Sandra","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Dreadful\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I had the previous version of the Paperwhite Kindle and I truly wish I had not decided to 'upgrade' to this version. I love to read and have over 1200 books in my Kindle library so I was seduced by the extra storage, the decision to buy was made easier by my friend losing her Kindle so I bought this version and donated my original Kindle to her. What a mistake that was.Firstly porting my library across to the new Kindle was an ordeal, having to deliver the books from my account took days. The books were there if I was connected to Wifi but disappeared once that was turned off, having to manually touch each book to allow for it to download to the device was tedious in the extreme. If there's an easier and faster way to do this I'd appreciate knowing how!Secondly the cover is already fraying at the edges, 25 pounds for something that after 3-4 weeks looks tattered is extortionate. The power button, as others have mentioned, is not protected by the cover either so annoyingly I've accidentally turned it off on a number of occasions when reading.Finally, and the most frustrating and enraging part of all is the absolute rubbish battery life. Allegedly one charge will last approximately a month, provided the wifi is turned off. I've had my kindle for approximately a month now and have had to recharge it every couple of days. It is now Wednesday, I charged it on Sunday and having used it for not even 2 hours the charge is already at 75%. And I have kept the wifi turned off with the device in Aeroplane mode! Something which I NEVER had to do with the previous Kindle, I could keep the wifi on and download books to my hearts content! Now I watch in horror while it takes between 2-4% to download a book!I am so disappointed and absolutely livid with this device, I have waited a month to review this item as I was aware that it may take some time for it to 'settle down' for want of a better description. I was conscious people had experienced issues with battery life what with downloading their library so I waited to allow for the device to have downloaded all my books and I'd used it for a couple of weeks before determining my final opinion.I am so disappointed with this device, and having the price reduced by £30 not even two weeks after purchasing has really rubbed salt in the wound. Although to be perfectly honest I would be enraged to have spent 99 pounds on it and have it work so poorly. It has proved to be such a frustrating and blood pressure raising waste of money. I'd love to ask my friend for my old Kindle back so I could return this model but good manners prevents me from asking!I purchased the 32GB Kindle with Special Offers. Rubbish, absolute rubbish.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"12 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Gadgetgrannie","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Lacks a sleep timer...\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love the new paperwhite, decided to upgrade from my original paperwhite mostly for the ability to listen to audio books on it.

At 7am this morning it was 100% charged it’s now 7pm and it’s down to 23%. I have less than 50 books on there and I’ve no idea why this happens. But once it gets like this it continues until I power it down and charge it up.This is third time I’ve changed this review. Both reviews are below so you can see the issues I’ve had.I’d just about given up on this kindle and returned to my old one but I decided to give it one more try. Before I began I shut it down and restarted it and now it’s back to how it was 3 months ago.I have less than 40 books on here (my previous one has over 700). All the books are downloaded and accounted for. So I’m not sure what the problem was but there was definitely a problem. I still don’t think the battery life is as good as my old one but with airplane mode set I’m now getting 3 or 4 days.*Second review after 3 months* - 1*I’ve had this kindle for over 3 months now and I’m changing my review. I originally gave this 3* and described it as a mixed bag.The reason for the change?The battery life is appalling. I switched it to airplane mode and turned the light off during the day but still I only get two days if I’m lucky. Plus I only have about 20 books on this one whereas my old one has over 700.Yes I read a lot hence me wanting the extra battery life.I fully switched back to my old kindle 4 days ago and it’s less than a quarter down despite me reading more and the light staying on.It’s a complete waste of money and I’m gutted since it was a gift from my daughter. I suppose I’ll use it on the rare occasions when I have a bath but beyond that no.There’s so many positive glowing reviews for this (one of the reasons I decided I wanted it) maybe mine is faulty but how do I tell?So many people are complaining about the battery life so is it a fault with the kindle design or is it only certain ones?*Original review* - 3*This is my fourth kindle. Yes I know but I read a lot and a kindle makes it so much easier.Each time I’ve upgraded I’ve had a reason. The original keyboard was awful so I changed that as soon as I could. My next one was a touchscreen and it worked well but it wasn’t backlit which meant I needed a light on when reading at night. And since I read into the early hours I upgraded again. I was happy with this kindle (the original paperwhite) and I said from the beginning I’d only buy another kindle if this either broke or a waterproof one came out. And here we are.I’ve not tested the waterproof feature yet and I will be nervous when I do. But it means I can now take a bath and not be frightened of falling asleep.All my other kindles are very similar but this one is different. From the home page to the controls and it will take me a while to get used to it.The big plus of course is the fact that it’s waterproof. But it’s also smaller and lighter and since I take it everywhere with me that’s a huge plus.And now the negatives.It doesn’t come with a charging block.Now this isn’t a problem for me since I already have 3 but I was surprised. I suppose there’s so many usb charges that Amazon thought it wasn’t necessary. But still.The screen doesn’t seem as natural as my previous Paperwhite. It’s more glaring and I’m not sure I like it as much.And the ‘special offers’ I didn’t realise it came with the constant advertisements. Now you could argue I should have checked but seriously why should a product like a kindle which over its lifetime will make Amazon money come with these adverts.I’ve had to pay an additional £10 just to get rid of them. This is money well spend since I had to swipe them away every time before I started reading which was just crazy.Conclusion.While this kindle has a lot of ticks in the plus column I think maybe I jumped too soon. I’ve wanted a waterproof kindle for so long that I saw this and wanted it. There was nothing wrong with my previous one in fact I’ll still continue to use that as well. Especially since I prefer the screen.I don’t think the lack of a charging block or the ‘special offers’ help Amazon. But then they’re making money at an alarming rate so they probably don’t care.I’ll admit after purchasing my original kindle I’ve never considered any other e-reader. I feel locked into Amazon and overall I’m happy but yes the ‘special offers’ are still bugging me. I occasionally use my iPad but I don’t like the backlit screen when I’m doing a lot of reading.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"18 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Jules","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not worth it, very dated\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This is a really poor device. I bought it solely for the waterproof function as I was still buying paperback for reading by the pool on holiday or in the bath.The device may as well be from the early 2000s. The interface is dated, there is a hideous lag in changing screens (and why can we not just scroll down like on the app?) and I can't get any item that has downloaded to open and the damn thing has been frozen for the past ten minutes - I have had the device for 20minutes.All in all, this device could have been better but I will be returning it.Also, the delivery driver didn't bother ringing the bell, he shoved this through the letterbox and we have a tile floor. Lucky for him it didn't drop onto it.Update: had to reset the device. After reset, the lag is still present and now the pages are flashing black when I turn them. When I invert the colours to be white text on black background, they flash white on turning. I googled the issue and it has been a long-running glitch with the kindle. You would think that it is something they would try to fix.Sorry kindle, waterproof reading just isn't enough of an incentive to keep an inferior device.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"23 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Mrs Gloria chittenden","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    KINDLE PROBLEMS\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    2 Kindle paperwhites delivered, one in French the other in \"Chinese\" There was no way we could link them to our account.

Whilst externally, the new Paperwhite 4 has a similar look to the previous Paperwhite 3, there are some subtle and not so subtle differences that mark this Paperwhite as a device to be reckoned with. Most of the changes are under the hood, and include a new 1500 mAh battery, upgraded LPDDR rom and a more powerful 1gb Cortex Processor. This brings the Paperwhite 4 in line with last year’s (2017) Oasis 2.And this is not the only thing in common the two devices have;The new Paperwhite 4 has the same IPX8 water resistance rating as the Oasis 2. For those not savvy on what the different IP water resistant ratings mean: this Kindle can survive an accidental dunking in water, or having a drink spilled on it. You can sit in the bath and use it. You can sit in a swimming pool and read from it. It can stand getting a little wet – BUT, it is not designed to be used underwater. So those hoping for a Paperwhite they can use whilst diving, or in the shower will be disappointed. But then, why would you want to read a book whilst you were diving or in the shower? The IPX8 rating is welcome, and frankly should be a standard on all future Kindles. I have suffered the annoyance of a Kindle being killed by a glass of water, thanks to the family cat. Whilst I keep all three separate these days, it’s nice to know that a little water isn’t going to kill the device.Audible integration has become a standard for Kindle eReaders since the launch of the Oasis 2 in 2017, and for those Kindles that have a Bluetooth chip installed. There hasn’t been an audio jack on a Kindle since the Third Generation Kindle Keyboard. The new Paperwhite 4 is no exception, this means you have to pair Bluetooth headphones with it to listen to your Audible books. The device is fully Bluetooth compliant, and I had no problems connecting any of the Bluetooth headsets I own.Audible integration works well on those eBooks where you opted to purchase the Audible narration, allowing you to switch between reading or listening to your book. Immersion reading is not supported however, but that makes perfect sense given the display is eInk. Switching from Audible to eBook will take you to the page you are on, rather than highlight the word. It’s not too big a problem. For those Audible books you own without the accompanying eBook, you can listen to them as normal.The Audible controls are basic, Amazon need to introduce a few more control options – such as the ability to stop at the end of a chapter, or a timer to stop playing after a set time. These are minor things that would improve the Audible experience on all the Kindle eReaders that support it. However, it is nice to have all your books – eBooks or Audible, on one dedicated device.Like the Oasis 2, the Paperwhite 4 has two storage options; 8gb and 32gb. This is a major improvement over previous generations which have 4gb. Kindle OS does use some of that storage, normally about 1gb to 1.25gb – but that’s still allowed the user to have around 1-2,000 eBooks on their Kindle. Storage has never been a big deal as Kindles have always had enough storage space for the most avid of readers. 8gb (minus the amount used by the OS) allows for storage of around 6-7,000 eBooks, depending on size per book. It allows for 30 or so Audible books – or a mix of the two. If you have a lot of eComics, then I would suggest opting for the 32gb version as they tend to be larger than eBooks or Audible files. Storage management is dealt with very nicely and has been since the 5.10 OS update that more modern Kindles received.So how does it feel and how does it perform? The Paperwhite 4 is lighter and thinner than the previous Paperwhite 3, at 181g it’s comfortable to hold. The rubbery non-slip back feels nice and has a natural warmth to it, it’s not as cold or as hard as a full metal or hard plastic back. Some people have said it feels “cheap” – but I counter that by pointing out how practical it is to have a non-slip back, that it sits well and holds well against your fingers. It adds to the comfort when holding the device. It adds some protection to the device against drops and will prevent corners being chipped or damaged by accident.The screen is flush this time, there is no raised bezel. Gorilla-glass covers the entire front of the device, and thanks to coatings is antiglare so reading in direct sunlight is not a problem. The display is still as crisp as the Paperwhite 3 – it is in fact the same 6 inch 300ppi E Ink Carta screen as used on the Paperwhite 3; this is one area that Amazon has not touched (and didn’t need to). Reading is a joy, and thanks to recent OS updates now offers numerous settings to customise the display to suit how you want to read. There is a built-in option to invert the screen, white text on a black background. This is particularly nice when reading before bed, as it puts less strain on the eyes.The flush bezel around the screen looks chunky but is designed well. It allows the device to be held without accidently touching the capacitive touch screen. It’s nice to see thought like this being put into the design. The touch screen is very responsive and allows for two-point touching, handy for the pinch and zoom options for text – and for PDFs and eComics.The screen is lit evenly by 5 LEDs, an increase from the 4 used on the Paperwhite 3. Lighting is evenly distributed across the entire screen. This is one area where there are very few issues these days as uniform lighting is something that has been mastered since its introduction in 2012. The LEDs are a different hue from previous Kindles. They are not as overtly blue as previous versions, but more a warmer colour. This is a nice change and gives the screen a more “paper like” look.There is no comfort light option, in fact there is no automatic light adjustment sensor at all. Like previous Paperwhites, the screen light has to be adjusted manually. This is – again – no change from the Paperwhite 3. Automatic light adjustment sensors and the like are a staple of the Flagship Kindle, the Oasis 2. It’s no surprise this option wasn’t included on what is now Amazon’s mid-level eReader.Out of the box, the device comes installed with Kindle OS 5.10.1.1 – which is the version used on more recent Kindle eReaders (Oasis, Oasis 2, Paperwhite 3). As soon as you connect to Wi-Fi you will be updated to 5.10.1.2 – an update that applies only to the Paperwhite 4, which adds to the overall performance of the device. This includes a new low power mode for when the kindle is switched off for more than an hour. It’s toggled on by default and will mean that if you leave your Kindle off for more than an hour is will take a little longer to wake up, as the device enters a hibernate mode when not used for more than an hour.Speaking of battery life; I got this on the day of release. I have charged it once. I don’t leave Wi-Fi on, or Bluetooth for that matter (I only toggle Bluetooth on when I want to use Audible). I have the screen light set to 10, the font size set to 5. I read a couple of hours a day, I have listened to an Audible book, which does hit the battery. But I have 63% left on the battery as of typing this. Given this includes setting the device up and leaving it to index the 500+ eBooks I downloaded onto it, I’m impressed. This bodes well for future battery life.Something a lot of people forget – or don’t know - when you load an eBook onto your Kindle, the device “indexes” it. This is all part of how any Kindle handles any eBook and allows you to search through it. All Kindle eReaders do this. So, if you dump 500+ eBooks on it, it’s going to take a few hours to index all those books and will cause a slow down on the device until it’s done. Even with a new processor and more ROM, the Paperwhite 4 is not a super-computer or high-end tablet. It’s a dedicated eReader. Give it time to do its job (2-4 hours if you dump 500+ ebooks on it) and then use it. You’ll get the best out of the device then and see just how well it does perform.Like previous Kindles, no wall socket adapter is included in the box, just the device and a Micro USB data/charging cable. It’s disappointing that Amazon haven’t taken the opportunity to make this the first Kindle eReader to have a USB-C port, rather than the old Micro USB. Of course, there would be no performance advantage in doing this, but rather make it more convenient in terms of making it easier to plug the cable in, and mean you only have to carry one cable with you when you go on holiday, as most modern phones use a USB-C type charging cable. But until it has an impact upon performance, I can’t see Amazon making this leap to changing the cable type needed.If you’re looking to upgrade your Kindle – or looking to get your first Kindle, but don’t have the budget for the Oasis 2, then this is a good device to go for. Remember, that if you opt to purchase a device “with special offers” you are going to have ads. They do not impact on either the device performance, or overall reading enjoyment.Overall, I’m going to give this 5-out-of-5. This is an amazing upgrade to the mid-range Kindle. It’s not a massive upgrade, but a welcome and recomended one.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"14 November 2018","ReviewerName":"R E Osborn","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Disappointed!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It's nice to have the extra storage and being able to play Audible books but no earphone jack, now have to buy Bluetooth.

Often, the touchscreen does not respond to touches even when it registers having been touched. When it does respond, you usually have to wait ages, and sometimes you are taken to a page you didn't want. Although I paid for 'without special offers', my Paperwhite is flooded with special offers -- personal book recommendations, free samples of books I don't want, Goodreads, Audible and so on. Books in my library are listed by photos of the covers which (a) makes the titles and authors sometimes hard to read and (b) makes scrolling through them agonisingly slow (as compared toscrolling down a list of titles). OK, so you can reset to a list display. I did this, but next time I visited my library it reverted to displaying photos of the covers. In addition to this, the set-up was basically an advertising campaign for Audible. At one point I got stuck for hours halfway through because I do not have a Bluetooth audio device, which is what you need for listening to Audible books. I don't want Audible but the device didn't want me to opt out of it: there wasn't a simple \"No thanks\" button. I did manage it in the end but it took a long time to get past the \"connect to Bluetooth audio device\" page. What you get is so different from what is advertised that I am sending it back.

My old kindle did not have a backlight and was one of the originals. So pretty basic. I must admit that the fact that I can now do this is pretty great and in that regard I am very happy. But unfortunately that is as far as it goes. I found that the lack of a basic set of instructions had me floundering around and getting frustrated with the lack of user friendly intuitive features. This device is not easy to find your way around and the touch screen and menus are difficult to use and manage. Personally I hate it and wish I had never made the change. Being waterproof does nothing for me as I can’t imagine sitting in the rain or anywhere that wet to read. Being able to withstand a shower would have sufficed for me. The extra storage capacity is a benefit however. All in all I guess I am pretty disappointed with my purchase as what I really wanted was a backlight and extra storage capacity on my old kindle.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"15 January 2019","ReviewerName":"Adriana","ProductRating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love it, but not in awe. (UPDATE: hypothesis confirmed. Adverts do heavily eat up your battery!!!)\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I like to get straight to the point: for having helped me read so much more and (as a first time kindle user) for having the ability to carry a stupid amount of books in something as small as a clutch bag, it has been by far the best purchase of my life, hands down. For that it gets 5 stars, but I'll tell you why I am taking down some. I work a lot with my eyes on the screen and cannot even stand reading the news online anymore (my line of work has damaged my still young eyes tremendously), so I've switched back to paper on many things I used to do on screen outside of my work. I live in a very small room in a shared flat which gets full from just a handful of books on my cabinet, so buying more paperbacks was impossible. I also read a lot of very old books which are impossible to read on paper unless you live inside the Bodleian. The kindle is far gentler on the eyes. I would definitely NOT say as gentle as I anticipated, considering the other drawbacks you get from an e-ink reader as opposed to something like a tablet (e-readers are quite sluggish and difficult to manage at times, this technology is still in the works). I can barely hold the backlight to the 5th line until it becomes really uncomfortable (I think that's not even halfway) HOWEVER, the inverted (black and white) option is a godsend. I can essentially lay in bed in the dark and still read off my kindle in this mode with only 3 lines of the backlight on. That said, come on Amazon...so many years in the ebook business, how much of a chore is it to add a slightly warmer coloured led to your devices? The light on this one has a painful blue tint when you set it too high. This is why it gets off its first star.The second one is -pardon my French- the pants claim that the battery lasts you weeks. It lasts me at best 2 with what I'd say is very minimal use on average(I carry this thing with me everywhere, but I am by no means a bookworm). I don't remember, but I think I found somewhere that said the battery  lasts as long as they claim if you read an average of 10 minutes a day. 10 minutes a day? I spend more time reading the back of my air freshner can when I am on the toilet (maybe that's too much info). For that it gets off another star. It'd get another one off if I'd add that it feels the ads themselves may be part of the reason why the battery dies off so quickly (it is just an assumption), and if that is proven to be the case, then £10 extra to buy off the full battery capability they claim to offer is quite foul play.Overall, I have since tested other friends' older kindles (including the 1st gen- the Voyage being my favourite) and this one gets a warm pass. I find it not a tremendous upgrade from something like the 7th gen kindle (though the black and white option, as I've said, is really good, and the older kindles don't have it). The audible idea is ok, but I think you need bluetooth headphones and speakers for that... so it's not like everybody will reap the benefits from this feature (personally phones are a much better option for this on so many levels). Waterproofing? Sure, if you desperately need to read in places where you might touch water, but I can manage reading just when I am dry without a problem, and for me it alone doesn't warrant paying the full price for the newest model. Twice the storage? This is debatable. It can be welcomed by some, if you cannot store your ebooks on something like a computer (which I do). Considering the very poor RAM, I like to keep max a couple of hundred books on it at a time. The rest are on my laptop, stored in my Calibre folder, waiting for their turn on my computer.  I bought this in the black friday sale at the more palatable price of 89 quid, but If I were to buy a kindle at this time, I would spy for a discounted previous generation (they sometimes still pop on amazon for 79 pounds).Update: had ads taken off after I got sick of them overlapping on top of one another after an update. The battery power is immesurably better (though I will note even before ads I kept wifi off; I largely use my kindle as a portable library rather than an online one).I have taken down another star for this reason (you are nowhere near getting your money's worth with the battery power it uses from adverts, and to add an extra £10 for a feature they already claimed to fulfil is quite disappointing), as well as another one I'll quickly ramble on now. After enjoying the reading experience off an ereader, I bought my partner a discounted new 3rd gen paperwhite (for £79 when amazon still brings one or two for sale) and -my God-, the screen on that one is so much better it is quite annoying. It has a scratchier plasticky display, however the white on that one is a nicer warmer one, and the text is blacker/sharper and bolder.  The reading experience on that one is so much more enjoyable, and feels much closer to reading an actual book than the new paperwhite I bought for myself; the text on the  new paperwhite is so much more faded compared to the previous one that it's obscene! But leave that aside, some font adjustments and you can get pretty close to the paperwhite 3, but the disgusting blue tint the from paperwhite 4's screen has really made me regret my purchase.TL; DR if you are a first time buyer of an ereader I quite recommend kindles so far. The interface is ok, and for me the vocabulary builder has been brilliant considering the kind of texts I read. I can't stress enough how much I recommend investing an ereader on its own; For how much use I make out of this kindle, I reckon it will pay off its worth in paperbacks immesaurably.  But after having also used paperwhite 3 and voyage, when it comes to rating this device alone, I don't think paperwhite 4 is worth the upgrade at all.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"13 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Andrew Falconer","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A brilliant buy.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Neat and slim.

The device is terribly slow. I mean, you tap and wait for a second for something to happen. I understand it’s not a personal computer or an iPad, but considering the only task it must fulfil is to render some text on screen, it’s unacceptably slow. And the “screen”. I know it’s not an actual screen and that the technology is quite different than, let’s say in PC monitors, but it’s just not good enough. The black is more like a washed-out grey, and the white, well, it’s yellowish and dim. The name “Paperwhite” is a joke. Anyway, the screen is so bad that it distracts me from reading. All I can think about is why the black is gray and white is yellow. It sounds ridiculous but it ruins the reading experience completely. Now don’t get me wrong, I think the idea of having a device which at a tap of a finger can turn into virtually any book ever written is wonderful. But the execution is just poor. I’d maybe pay around £50 for this “all-new Kindle Paperwhite”, but for £120 it’s extortion. One thing worth mentioning as well is the fact that the advertised battery life is “weeks”, but after using it from a fully charged state for approximately 3 hours it dropped to 56%. Maybe I got a lemon, but I doubt it, several people have mentioned the same issues in other comments. To sum up: don’t buy it. Or wait until it sells for £50.

I have tried using waterproof covers on my PW2 but the experience isn't great as the touch screen doesn't work properly.  The new PW4 model is slightly smaller and noticeably lighter than the PW2.  The PW2 screen is great and the PW4 screen is even better (marginally crisper).  The backlight on the PW4 is slightly more even but no massive change here either.Positives for me:- waterproof: fantastic for reading in the bath!- faster: the PW4 seems to be faster overall, particularly noticeable when switching on- \"dark\" mode: this is a feature that isn't promoted in the PW4 advertising but I think it is a game changer for those reading in bed in the dark.  The PW4 has an additional Accessibility menu with the option of making the background black and the text white - much less strain on the eyes when reading in the dark and less likely to disturb others- Audible integration: not sure how much I will use this as I use Audible on my iPhone but could be useful- thinner/lighter: PW4 feels much nicer to hold and feels much lighter than the 30g lighter it shows on my scales- backlight on PW4 switches off completely.  PW2 backlight can be dimmed but does not switch off.Negatives: Nothing major- the backlight on the PW4 does not seem to dim as much as on the PW2.  The lowest setting on the PW4 before it is switched off equates to about 4 \"blobs\" on the PW2 backlight.  Only an issue if reading at night in the dark and the \"dark\" mode mentioned above is much better for this.- I really wanted a 3G/4G model but that would have meant getting a 32GB model which was twice the price.  Why not make the 8GB model available with 3G/4G?  Not a massive issue as can connect it to my iPhone personal hotspot if requiredOverall I am very pleased with the PW4.  A worthwhile upgrade in my view.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"22 November 2018","ReviewerName":"bahram pourkomailian","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    storage misleading\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    it states 8 GB but once you switch it on and connect to wifi you can see on Device Info free space is only 6 GBDisappointing\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"13 November 2018","ReviewerName":"JJ","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I love this.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I had a couple of hiccups at first.

The screen itself is slightly embedded, with the touch screen layer above it, so it's a smooth surface, which is a smart design decision.With old Kindles I've had problems with scratching the backlit screen (which cast ugly shadows), so this one being scratchproof is a godsend! Plus the light comes from the sides now, which more than ever gives the surface a clean, even look that lets the text stand out.And I've begun to read in the bath.

Common thing about these reviews is they concentrate on the obvious stuff, double storage, waterproofing etc. They however fail to elaborate on the most important part, the screen, all they do is mention its 300 ppi. So I wanted to focus on the screen and mention a few things I wish I knew before purchasing (not that it would have stopped me anyway but I like to be informed). I uploaded a video as well that demonstrate what I'm about to review.Firstly I was excited about the inverted colour mode. Previously I had the cheaper kindle, without the backlit screen but sometimes when I have trouble falling asleep I like to read and I don't want to disturb my girlfriend with lights on so I decided to buy the new paperwhite seeing how happy she was with her older 2nd gen paperwhite. So the dark mode was something I really looked forward to but it turned out to be a let down. The problem is the system seems to be rendering the page first in normal colour mode than it swiftly changes it to dark mode. It looks like it can buffer a few pages ahead but every 10 or so pages and it needs to \"refresh\" causing the screen to flash (see the video) This is quite annoying in a dark room and it completely defeats the purpose of the dark mode. More over to add to inconvenience the kindle does this with medium brightness so after the darkest setting I use for reading it really hurts my eyes.The same thing happens if I just turn on the kindle, the kindle starts up with full brightness and then automatically goes to the last used brightness level, which is again less than ideal in a dark room. I wouldn't be bothered with it if I didn't know that my girlfriendsolder paperwhite can remember the brightness level and it starts up with the last used setting.The other nuance I noticed is the minimum brightness on the new paperwhite is about 2-3 times brighter than the previous gen ones. I understand this is due to the increased numbers of led's around the screen and it wouldn't be really an issue if the dark mode worked. However as mentioned earlier the dark mode is not perfect so I'm left with the normal mode and the increased brightness strains my eyes more.On the other hand - unlike the previous paperwhite models - you can actually turn off the screen light (see end of the video) which is immensely helpful when reading outdoors as you don't need any backlight with an e-ink display. This conserves battery and leads to a more pleasant reading experience.Issues aside the new paperwhite is really one of the best choice out there and I can live with it's faults but I wouldn't be suprised if someone thought these issues to be a deal breaker for them. The battery life is amazing I'm a casual user and I leave the kindle in airplane mode most of the times and the battery saver is switched on. After 19 days the battery is on 62%.The new kindle paperwhite has everything going for it to become the perfect e-reader in its price range but a software update is needed to address the mentioned issues.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"13 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Amazon Customer Alex","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Big fan of the Paperwhite\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have three Kindle Paperwhite devices, one in the lounge, one in the car and one in the bedroom.

Well, that depends on your experiences with devices.But imo, Amazon did a great job designing the interface.I'm using this to read manga mostly and some of them have a neat feature where you can click onto one image and zoom in on the whole screen to see clearer where you can also swipe to the next segments of that 1 page.The ink technology gave me the impression that it would have very dark blacks just like Oled, but when you set the brightness higher, the contrast loses a lot and it seems Very washed out.There is also another feature that lets you pinch to zoom and move the image, but the technology needs to refresh every time for it to be sharp, if not the ink will leave smudges from the previous image. Just like a burn in effect.The coating is good at reflecting the lights so there is no glare.For some reason I expected to be bigger and it was a bit of a let down. But is fine, I think I'll consider the Oasis if I'll end up returning it.All in all, I would say that brightness + ink = bad contrast or mine is just faulty, if it is faulty I'll like to have another one.If not, I'll try the Oasis.Edit:  I want to tell you that it can actually achieve a decent contrast while on the lowest brightness setting. But the caveat is that you MUST use a lamp or light on top of it so you can actually see the screen e.g. images, and read.One of the features that help you read manga on such a small screen is double tapping onto one segment of the page, from there it lets you focus and zoom in which is a night and day difference.I haven't tried manhua style yet, where the positioning of the images are different, which a vertical stripe reading style would be more streamline.So... a summary of this rubbish review would be:  Awesome for reading text, good-ish for manga.Just get the Oasis or a Kobo with larger screen for manga.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"4 December 2018","ReviewerName":"SLJ","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    More pros than cons\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Much less strain on the wrists compared to an iPad and better on the eyes for extended reading, particularly since the screen light can be switched off entirely.

Would have preferred the on-off switch to be at the opposite end of the device.Would love a sleep timer for audiobooks! I tend to fall asleep and wake several hours later to find that it is still playing.Whispersync does not always seem to sync properly.Also, I find the word 'Kindle' on the front a bit annoying, since I don't like reading it constantly.

This product feels premium and very lightweight. Once setup was complete I’ve found navigating my way very simple I thought it’d be a little complicated compared to my old device. One of the main reason why I bought this was because Of the built-in light, which looks fantastic, makes reading time at night a lot better. You can also adjust the lights brightness, one thing I’d have liked amazon kindle to have is a button where you can toggle the light on/off rather than having to go to the settings menu to adjust the brightness to zero. Another reasons why I purchased this was because of the water resistant feature, which is great considering the fact that I read a lot during my bath times.What I dislike about this product is the adverts (special offers) on home screen, which doesn’t go away unless you pay an additional £10 charge.

Also the 32gb memory was only 27.5 gb  I queried this and was told that is normal. Add to that the fact that I, like lots of others, were charged £30 extra for the Kindle. We pre ordered this several weeks before it was released. Two or three weeks after we received them, the price plummeted by £30. Now I see, it’s gone back up again. Why can’t they make their minds up. Unfortunately, very unfair of Amazon and it explains why only two stars.

The light on the 10th Generation is nowhere near as bright as the one on the 7th, to get the same illumination I have to have it set at 19 (was 15 on the 7th Generation unit) - as I use the Paperwhite instead of a light in my bedroom when reading this is quite an important distinction for me.  I notice that the battery life tests were done with the unit set to 13 - this is not adequate illumination on this new model unless using in an area that is already dimly lit rather than dark.Battery life is my next bone of contention - I have run my own little test and from a  full charge it seeps 2% of iot's power by being left in standby for around an hour.  This does not bode well for my reading time - I can usually get through 2 full novels on the 7th Generation before needing to charge but I am not sure that this will be the case on the 10th Generation.  I will fiddle with the settings but so far I have a bad feeling about this upgraded unit.I also do not like the new home screen.  I want the unit to default to either the book I am reading or to the main library page.  I do not want this \"home page\" showing various things in side bars and bottom bars on the screen.  I know it is just a click to get to my library but I would rather go straight there on completion of a book instead of having to click through to it.  I understand that there is a marketing opportunity for Amazon here but honestly, I have over 250 unread books in my cloud and I have never bought direct from my kindle, preferring to visit the website to browse.That's the other thing, I am trying to download my unread books from the Cloud on to my Kindle and it does not seem to support bulk downloading properly so it has got through 40-odd of them and now seems to have stalled.  Worse, there is no way of resetting it so I can go through and laboriously download novel by novel.  I've reset my modem at this end but to no avail - hopefully time will work it's magic and by tomorrow I will be able to start again.  It would be nice if there was a way to cancel the downloads from the website itself when they don't go through.Now on to the good bits about it.The unit itself is light and site nicely in the palm of the hand which makes prolonged rewading sessions far more comfortable than with a traditional paper book.  The screen taps to move forwards and back in the book are not too sensitive that you can accidentally change pages when shifting position but not so firm that you need to whack it to get your page to change.There are lots of text options both for the font and the overall size displayed.  This makes it simple to set it up to suit your own reading preferences (I go for Bookerly and size 2).  The black on white text is clear and easy to read and can be changed in the settings if you find that difficult to read.The storage in the 8Gb is ample for book readers and I have loads left with around 50 books downloaded on there (some are compilations containing 3 or 4 books so larger than the average file).  I do delete as I read just for ease of picking my next book but there really is no need to.I went with the version that has Special Offers.  These are simply a splash screen when waking the unit from Sleep mode and all you need to do is swipe up and you are straight back to your open book.  They are non-intrusive and I don't feel it is really worth the extra £10 to get rid of them.The build quality is sturdy and I do hope to never having to test the splashproof bit of the unit.  However, I did upgrade to the 10th Generation so I can read literally anywhere with it - especially in the bath which is something I was always loathe to do with the 7th Generation \"just in case\".Once I get the light level/battery life balance right I am sure I will be more than happy with my purchase - even more so when I can get all my unread books downloaded.  For now I will just leave it with a slightly critical review.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"25 December 2018","ReviewerName":"JHo","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Superior text quality on old model\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    You can clearly see from the photos that the blacks aren't as black on the new model (right) The text doesn't appear as distinct against the background making it harder to read.

Audio via bluetooth is not a key requirement for me.  Overall it is not much smaller than the paperwhite 3. It still has massive bezels.  Also the screen glass they put for waterproofing makes the screen as smooth as a tablet.  I suspect it would also make it more reflective like a tablet but I have not tested it. The viewing angle is not as good as paperwhite 3 most like due to the glass on screen. The micro usb (why not usb C? ) slot and power\\sleep button are still at the bottom and exactly where your finger would  naturally go causing many unintentional sleeps and this new model wakes up from sleep significantly more slowly than paperwhite 3.  It is not rocket size to move them to the top and Amazon should know it as they have it with fire tablets.Also as it does not have physical page turn buttons, Amazon should have software dedicated page turn areas at each edge taking priority over links, ideally bottom left and right corners for single hand users for current day commuters. This is particularly problematic when you have page full of links, e.g. table of content page.Only area this model feels better is that lighting is smoother thanks to the extra LED. Paperwhite 3 with 4 LEDS had shadowy areas at the botoom.Overall Amazon has been in its comfort zone for so long with the Kindle devices with little improvement with each new release.  Comparatively kindle devices are significantly more expensive than the fire tablets comparing the materials used.  The only competitor Kobo does not have enough muscle to disrupt the market and surprisingly it has been one market Chinese players have not jumped onto.To sum it up, it is ok as the first kindle e-ink device but if you have any recent e-ink book reader it is really not worth the upgrade.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"19 July 2019","ReviewerName":"M. L. Tanner","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A nice upgrade from my husband's 1st edition Kindle Paperwhite.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I received my new Kindle Paperwhite today, and I'm very pleased with it. The display is much clearer and brighter than the old one and it charges more quickly. The additional storage is nice to have, as I read MUCH more than my husband does and was constantly having to cycle books off his Kindle to make room for more. This one should hold enough to get me through an entire two-week holiday without having to find a wi-fi hotspot! I haven't actually dunked it in water (I mean, I'm not stupid), but it claims to be waterproof in up to two metres of water for up to 60 minutes, which seems like more than adequate protection for the average person, who's more likely to read it in the bathtub or at a rainy bus stop than while deep sea diving.I'd like to address some complaints I've seen from other reviewers, many of which seem to be based largely on failure to read the product listing thoroughly. The most common issue seems to be the presence of advertising instead of screensavers. That's what you get when you buy it at the promotional price, which is £10 cheaper. It does not flash ads at you throughout the book -- they only appear in place of the screensaver, and are easily dismissed by swiping up. I find them easy to ignore, but if you find ads that distressing, pay the extra £10. If you can afford a Kindle you're not *that* hard up, now, are you?One frequent complaint is that books can only be downloaded from the cloud by clicking them individually; this is not true. It was extremely easy to transfer books onto it from our family library using the Amazon website's \"Manage Your Content and Devices\" menu under \"My Account\". Once on your library (or family library) page, simply click \"Select All\" and you can download everything you have in one click. It does take a minute or two per book, but if you're expecting to download dozens or hundreds of books instantaneously you're delusional anyway.Some reviewers complain that the screen is more 'glaring' and less like reading a real book than earlier Kindles. First off, no e-reader will ever duplicate the experience of reading a real book. If you're that fussy about it, buy real books. That's what I do most of the time, but the Kindle is very useful for travel and other places I'd rather not take paper books (I used to take a second suitcase on holiday just for books). I also don't use the Kindle for any book I feel strongly about owning forever, because let's face it: Kindle books aren't really yours, you're just buying a license to read them. If Amazon were to go under, you would lose access to any that weren't already on your device.As for the screen itself, I don't find it 'glaring' or excessively bright at all. It is very white, but that's because it's a greyscale display. You can enable white text on a black background if you prefer (this is in the Accessibility preferences). I will say that the contrast doesn't seem quite as strong as on the older Kindle (the text seems less black), but given that the light is much more consistent, I don't find that problematic.If you prefer a blue light filter for reading at night, you'd do better to buy a nice full colour tablet. I would not recommend a Fire tablet; I have one and the display has very poor resolution and is not good for reading. My Samsung Galaxy Note is clearer, but not as crisp as the Kindle -- which is why I decided to buy my own after using my husband's for several months.I've also seen several people complain about battery life. If you read the product description, it clearly states that battery life of up to several weeks is possible if you are reading for 30 minutes per day with wi-fi turned off and the backlight set to 13. If you're reading for a couple of hours or more a day and leaving the wi-fi on, obviously your battery life will suffer.When turned on, the wi-fi works very well. The touchscreen seems more responsive than the older Paperwhite. Page transitions are slightly faster (though still not seamless), and the device feels substantial and well made despite being about 50g lighter than my husband's device. I don't enjoy audiobooks, but I tested the Audible narration with a bluetooth speaker and it does work perfectly well. The Paperwhite does come with a USB connector but no plug for an electric socket, so if you're short on those you might want to pick one up. The Amazon-branded one is ridiculously overpriced, however, given that you can buy a perfectly serviceable one for less than £5 elsewhere.I'm very pleased with this purchase. I do feel like the Kindle is a little pricier than it needs to be, but it's a solid device and does what it says on the box. No serious complaints from me; my only quibble is with the contrast, and it's in no way serious enough to complain about. If you're happy with your existing Kindle I wouldn't recommend upgrading, but if you think the increased storage, decreased weight, and waterproofing add value, it's well worth picking up.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"18 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Genuine buyer ","ProductRating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Very disappointed with this new product\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I was very disappointed with this because the description was totally misleading !It advertised that you could connect via Bluetooth to listen to your book .When I couldn’t connect to Bluetooth to listen to a kindle book I rang amazon help desk .

My last kindle was a voyage which I loved but will no longer charge. I looked at current models only to find there isn't an updated voyage so reluctantly ordered the paperwhite. The voyage was a touch screen but also had discreet buttons on the side and magnets to close a cover. There is nothing at all so when the page is full of text there is no room to use the touch screen. You can swipe but it's hit and miss. But the worse thing is trying to download from the cloud. My whole library is there ok, but when I have read a book I add it to my read collection. If you add a book to a collection now it stays on the screen which is pointless and a retrograde step. I now have hundreds of books which I don't know if I've read until I've downloaded them which will take forever and then when I add them to the read collection they remain on the screen. I would like to return it but only have a very old kindle with no light as my lovely voyage is going to die any minute. I can't believe how bad it is but even if I get the oasis I will still have problems locating my read and unread books.  Also there are no magnets so the cover does not switch right off. Further info.  I have had to return it as even though it was 100% charged when I went to bed in the morning it was only 50% and kept going down as you watched it. All with no Bluetooth or wi fi.  It was obviously faulty but having spent hours downloading my library I was not pleased to have to return it.  Unfortunately I had also purchased a cover for it which I also had to return because I can't face another Paperwhite so it was useless, and found I had to pay the return postage which really annoyed me as I would have kept it if the Kindle had not been faulty so not my fault I had to return it.  Obviously the cover was not faulty but nevertheless it would have been good of Amazon to waive the postage on it.  Having a think about getting an Oasis but so upset of the Paperwhite really fed up with Kindles.  Why oh why could Amazon not have updated the Voyage which I love and have had no issues with.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"28 December 2018","ReviewerName":"Kath Mardle","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I loathe it\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I got this as a Christmas gift having wanted one for a long while due to my old kindle getting a bit tired and chipped.

Haven't done much reading on it yet as i have spent the last few days uploading my books and reorganising collections.  Unless I am missing something, there is no automatic way to download books from the vcloud, so it needs manual effort.  The kindle has been frustratingly slow and I have had to reset it several times after it has frozen.  Sometimes it has taken 3 or 4 attempts to add a book to a collection (it appears to work, but the book doesn't move into the collection).  I have also renamed a couple of collections in the cloud, but the names have not updated on the device, although they contain the same books.  Moving between pages on the library home screen can be incredibly slow, meaning i get frustrated and end up swiping too often and going beyond where i want.  All in all, much slower than my Fire tablet or my original kindle.Update - a small number of books that I have successfully assigned to collections remove themselves!

I bought mine on offer nearing Fathers Day so saved £20.The 10th Generation Paperwhite is brilliant.  The screen is crisper, backlight is brighter, more responsive and once you've signed in, all your books are in the Cloud ready to download and resume your reading.A bonus I find is in the Accessibility settings, you can invert the screen so the background is black, and the text white.  I find this is great for night time reading and it's easier on my eyes as a result. Super!Having read through the Kindle User Guide, Im delighted to see we can add our own custom fonts to the device. It adds a great personal touch to your Kindle if you're bored of the de facto fonts that come as standard.  It's as easy as downloading some fonts from the internet to your computer and then transferring the fonts to the relevant folder within the Kindle via USB.  I've added a few photos as an example.  I love the handwritten style font, as well as Courier New typewriter style fonts. A refreshing change from Bookerly and really adds to the immersive experience when reading different genres of books.I don't intend to use the bluetooth/ Audiable feature on my Kindle.  So I haven't reviewed it.  I'm quite content reading my ebooks.The waterproof feature is a big bonus for me as I like to read my Kindle while relaxing in the bath.  I don't have to stick it in a pouch anymore.  Easy to handle, featherweight to hold.  I bought a new cover for my new Kindle that has a stand and hand strap which makes it super convenient to use.Only downside - I feel the battery life isn't as long as my previous Kindle. I could go literally weeks and weeks between charges, but with new Kindle I might have to charge once a fortnight or more. I noticed someone else mentioning battery life, so it can't just be me that has a fluke battery or something lol. Even with the WiFi off, it drains quicker.8/10 - I love my new Kindle Paperwhite 10th Gen.  Super stuff.

Logging on to Amazon imagine my surprise and excitement to find an all singing, all dancing paperwhite! Not only is it waterproof BUT it’s now with Audible, my mother is going to LOVE this feature. I purchased the Kindle from Amazon Spain and paid 129.99 Euros = £115.63 GBP however, have just been on the UK site and see it’s currently as of 18.11.18 at a bargain price of £89.99 GBP. If you are thinking of upgrading or purchasing as a present I can highly recommend this Kindle having used it for the past week registering it on behalf of my mother and downloading books and ensuring it’s going to be an easy changeover for her as she is in her eighties!

I just upgraded from the 6th Gen but was it worth it?Putting aside that I got a great deal on prime day I was looking to upgrade anyway.  My old case needed replacing and I wanted the latest tech so chose to make the leap.Noticeable differencesI love the flat surface, this to me is one of the better changes.  I like things to look new and one thing that use to annoy me was the amount of dust that was collected around the dip where the screen was in the 6th generation even though I had a closing case on it.  Not only did it attract dust but the black finish around the edges where you held the kindle was a magnet for fingerprints and greasy marks.  The new kindle doesn’t have this issue with a completely flat front it makes it simple to wipe clean without having to get around edges and while the new one still shows fingerprints they are not as noticeable.  Thumbs up from me!It’s thinner and easier to hold.  This mostly is because of the bottom which is now smaller and all one size whereas the 6th Gen had a wider bottom and my thumb would always sit there which wasn’t comfortable.  This new one eliminates that issue perfectly.Differences that are there but not really noticeableScreen looks pretty much the same, maybe the text is a little clearer but unless you had them side by side you wouldn’t notice.It’s lighter but again unless I have them both in my hand, I really wouldn’t notice.  I have a case on them anyway so this adds to the weight.It’s water resistant…….I don’t read in the bath or in a swimming pool but it’s handy to know it’s there.You can store audiobooks and the space has doubled to 8GB (unless you go for the 32GB) Again I don’t use audiobooks and if I did I would probably use my phone so 8GB is more than enough as I never filled my 4GB one before.  Those of you wanting to use the audiobooks you can link Bluetooth headphones as there is no headphone jack.Things that seem the sameSpeed at which you swipe pages, turn the device on and navigate the kindle to me all seem the same speeds.Any negatives?Mostly minor.  I would have liked to see a USB-C charging point as this is the way tech is going and it’s a quicker charging time.Battery life seems a little worse than the 6th Gen. I am 35% into my first book on here and I am down to 68% in less than a week whereas my 6th Gen didn’t ever seem like it needed charging.  I am using it at night more so maybe it’s the backlight. This is based on the same settings (You can improve your battery by turning off wifi but I wanted to do a comparison)Wake up isn’t instant and you have to swipe to unlock.  My old one just turned onto where I was reading rather than have an extra thing to do to wake up.  My feelings are this is because you now have a flat screen and it’s easier to hit so you may move the page but another part of me see’s this as Amazon’s way to put advertisements on the screen.VerdictA much nicer smaller Kindle that feels comfortable to hold when reading which is all I want from these devices.  The only real concern to me is the battery life compared to my previous Gen 6 however I am pleased I made the jump and this is a recommended product from me.Happy Reading\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"24 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Bookreader","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not hugely impressed\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    So my new paperwhite arrives and like others I find that the charging cable doesn't fit.

It lasts LESS THAN A DAY and that was only reading a normal book. I tried switching off the backlight and even putting it in air-plane mode. I followed all the troubleshooting advice to no avail and I just got off chat to arrange a replacement. I'll see how that goes. Hopefully I had a faulty device. When I asked the agent what to do if I had the same issue I wasn't given any options just \"It won't happen again\"We'll see.Bottom line, this wasn't cheap. I paid £179.99 for this device and at the moment I wish I hadn't. I only bought it to have the convenience of the 4G and the bigger memory and honestly I don't see much difference in design or quality from my old Kindle. It does connect to my Audible library and I think it uses Bluetooth to play the books but I use my phone Audible app for that. My old Kindle was the cheapest version and it blew this one out of the water as far as battery goes and the battery on that is no where near as good as my Kobo. Should have stuck with it, in fact I've gone back to the old Kindle while I wait for the new one. So my advice at the moment is unless you NEED to upgrade, DON'T.UPDATE: 2nd Kindle better in that the battery lasted 3-4 days. Not good enough. Sent back for refund after some customer service shenanigans (they don't like to make it too easy do they?). Back to my old one which still gets at least a week if not more.UPDATE: I am STILL trying to get my money back for the returned Kindle. I returned it 10 days ago and have been going around in circles with Amazon customer services trying to get my £180 back.

It can be new or refurbished.The device looks like new and it does seem to work fine. But, I do find a refurbished device as a replacement, when the Kindle was just 9 months old, very disappointing.When it breaks down again, and unfortunately it does seem to be of much lesser quality than the older versions (we have two of these used by other family members), I won’t replace it with a new Kindle, I think.

It's a similar shaped device without dedicated back/forward buttons which I can live with, but sometimes it seems to go off a few pages in one direction or other and I've still not figured out whether it's something I'm doing, or a fault with the system.It is marketed as being waterproof, but the first thing that strikes you when it arrives is the way they back-peddle with the instructions that come with it.  They say that if you accidentally immerse it in water, switch off, remove the cover and sit it upright to drain water from the bottom charging port.  You also have to allow it to dry off, so that's not what the term \"waterproof\" means to me, and I doubt I'm alone.  The key takeaway there is not to be immersing it lazily like they show in the adverts.  A shame, but I'm not massively bothered as long as it survives the first time I drop it in the bath.The positioning of the on/off switch on the bottom of the device is going to annoy people too, as depending on how you hold the device, your fingers may well press it from time to time.  I've gotten used to not pushing it, and my case helps to keep it safe from pressing too, but I suspect it's on the bottom for draining purposes to keep the price down.in use the device is nippy, with the usual fraction of a second refresh-rate for the e-ink that's to be expected.  You can swipe left and right or tap to change pages, although I find myself trying to scroll down from time to time, which brings up the navigation window.  That's a hang-over from using all my other devices, but I still do it from time to time.The home page defaults to an annoyingly intrusive shopping experience that I found difficult to navigate because it was so cluttered.  I soon found my old library screen though, so that was a short-lived annoyance.  I do however resent being charged £10 extra for the device so that I am not advertised at, but to counter that at least the extra storage RAM I elected to buy wasn't Apple prices expensive, especially as I'm unlikely to use it but am a sucker for MOAR RAM.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"17 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Urban Vaper","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great To Be Back . . .\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I owned one of the very first kindles, and really enjoyed reading on it.Christmas 2014, and one of my dearest friends bought me a Kindle Fire for a present.

I wanted to replace my old Kindle Paperwhite like for like, but they do not seem to sell them any more, so I had to go for the Waterproof instead.I imagine that, like me, many people first came to the Kindle Paperwhite because their eyesight was beginning to deteriorate. The two marvellous Kindle features are that you can increase the font size to something you can easily read, and (amazingly) it works just as well in the dark, the half light, daylight and bright sunshine. Any other device would simply \"bleach out\" in direct sunlight, but the Kindle, if anything, is easier to read under those fierce conditions!The design flaw is this: although you can increase the font size to read a book comfortably, it makes no difference to the font size in the menus and options. So, although I can read the book, I can not find it in the first place!On this new Waterproof Kindle, some of the menu fonts are smaller than the original Paperwhite. My only course of action is to carry around a magnifying glass - and it is not easy to hold the Kindle, hold a magnifying glass and tap the screen with only two hands.Worse, on this new Waterproof version, many options are both tiny and greyed out.

My previous Paperwhite - the 2015 model - is not just the best e-reader I own, but my most cherished of all devices. Disappointingly, the 2015 model continues its reign as this new Paperwhite is flimsy, often unresponsive and uncomfortable for both hand and eye. Indeed, I would argue that Amazon are being completely disingenuous by adding this to their Paperwhite line, given that the screen is, at best, grey. Even with the light turned up to its limit, the page is nowhere near white and the light itself is headache-inducing.There are pros. The new Paperwhite is incredibly light and, apparently, waterproof and supports Audible audio. Also, unlike the 2015 model, the screen is flush - but I see this as a con as fingerprints invariably show up all over the screen and you'd be dicing with danger if you chuck this in a bag without a case (the 2015 model could be handled however one wished without worry.)What hurts the most about this \"advance\" in Paperwhite tech is that Amazon will probably continue to make their Kindles to the same standard from now on.

The buttons on the side , made it easy to turn pages whilst holding onehanded by pressing down with my thumb. The swipe feature has to be done by moving across the screen, doesn't always turn in the right direction and sometimes turns several pages.3. It is easy to accidentally open the bars at the top or bottom, which then pop up covering the text this is very annoying.Having said this, the backlight is useful when reading in the car (As a passenger) and in bed during the night as it doesn't disturb the driver/my husband.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"2 January 2019","ReviewerName":"PeterJ","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Disappointing & Annoying\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    After upgrading from the previous Paperwhite to the new 32g version, this is a disappointment. On opening the £119 Kindle, you are blasted by a series of advertisements, in order just to get to your home page. This is off-putting, invariably setting the wrong mood & tone for my ‘reading mode’. Advertisements should be an optional setting, as something you can turn off and on, as you require, on that particular day. Amazon need to make this retrograde ‘feature’ very clear to buyers before they make the purchase. The new Paperwhite also feels less robust & substantial than the former one, and the battery often appears to be going down visibly as I use the thing, something I never noticed on the older model, whose battery seemed to last for ever.

It had buttons and a slightly clumsy menu-based interface. Crumbs, I miss it. I've tried various e-readers (we were early adopters of Kindles and gone through several, also had a Nook). This one is not as annoying or as heavy as that ridiculous Kindle Fire but it's definitely not my favourite.I've been using the new one for a month or so. I wanted to like it and it's okaaay when actually reading a book but is a right p.i.t.a. when changing to a new book or trying to navigate around. There are a number of things I dislike about it.* it's just that little bit heavier than the old one* I thought it was meant to be paperwhite, like the name implies. It's not. The backlight has to be on ALL the time. The battery life isn't nearly as good as the button Kindle; also the light is sort of blue. It may be my imagination but blue light isn't meant to be good for reading before bed and it seems to be interfering with my sleep a bit* the navigation is just awful and awkward. How do you get back to the beginning of a book? Tap it at the top, then hit one of the weird little icons at the bottom which pulls up a slide bar that doesn't slide. What then? TAP the left side of the slide bar which gets you close to the beginning of the book but not quite? Hit one of the FIVE arrows to move left or right? Show the page display and work your way back?  (Hint: Don't use the lower left arrow -- that closes the pop-up and takes you back to where you started).  WHY for heaven's sake doesn't it just bring up the table of contents that practically every ebook has built in? Even the horrible Fire does that.* Suddenly my family's books, most of which I have no interest in reading, are all showing up from the Family library thing. They've all magically appeared. I figured out a workaround (creating a special collection for their books and adding them to them) but it's just one more annoyance.  Also all MY collections that were stored on the old Kindle have gone so I'm having to recreate them in the online app.All in all, it's been a frustrating and annoying replacement for a device I was happy with, with a high-learning curve. Oh, and having to pay an extra £10 to switch off adverts just rubs salt in the wound. I pondered buying a Kobo and think I probably will for the next one. It can't be more irritating than this \"improved\" Kindle.UPDATE: 13 June 2019 - I finally found the menu item for the table of contents. It's the \"Go To\" option that's visible when you're in book-reading mode.  I didn't think it worked before because if you're not careful and touch it *exactly* in the centre of the words, it launches the Bookmark thing next to it.  It would be nice if software development teams would talk to each other and try to synchronise their changes to the interface. For example, the Go To on the Kindle App on my phone is on a drop-down menu that actually looks like a menu. But sadly, having a standard interface that benefits customers is less profitable than squeezing in more advertising - like Goodreads that's taking up space on TWO menus all the time.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"29 December 2018","ReviewerName":"David Paterson","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A superb value e-reader with a glaringly obvious design flaw (curse you power button!)\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have loved my wife's 4th generation Kindle ever since I stole/liberated it several years ago from her neglectful hands.  As a reading experience, it was absolutely what it needed to be and I used it daily. As a result, it's looking a little worse for wear now, starting to get a little bit of screen bleed and has an annoying black spot on the screen.  I was clamouring for a new Kindle and when this came up for sale for £90 over the Black Friday weekend, I directed the wife (with a great lack of subtlety) to purchase it for Christmas for me (after spending more research time on e-readers then I spent on buying a house).Firstly, I cannot be understated as to how great a value proposition this device is.  The lighting goes to ridiculously bright levels (I usually read in the dark on setting 7-8 and it goes all the way to 24 or something) and makes nighttime reading a real joy, something which I couldn't do with my old Kindle.  The waterproofing works - a dunk in the bath didn't effect it (even if it did effect my breathing) and I can see that this being a really useful feature for me.It's light, which is really important for one handed reading and the touch screen has a really pleasing textured feel.  I thought I might miss physical page turn buttons more than I actually did, and found that the touchscreen was really responsive.  I love being able to do quick dictionary look ups and browsing the store is far far better than the 4th generation Kindle.Right, let's talk about the flaw.  As I said, I've conducted lots of research into e-readers before settling on this Kindle and was debating switching to Kobo but in the end - 90 quid cannot be sneezed at.  No reviews I read or watched seemed to mention this problem, but it started annoying me almost immediately - the flipping power button location is absolutely horrendous.I've lost count of the number of times I've accidentally switched off the device while reading and how this design choice has got through product testing, I'll never know.  The 4th generation Kindle has the power button in the same location, yes, but it is recessed into frame so that accidental button pushes are nigh on impossible.  This one sticks out a good 2mm (see attached picture) from the frame and when you're reading one handed (or at least when I'm reading one handed) my little finger rests underneath the power button.  I'm having to consciously think about how I'm holding the device, which is definitely not what you want or need when you're trying to immerse yourself in a book.There's a good chance that this could just be me and the way that I hold it, but it definitely detracts from an otherwise flawless reading experience.  I've had to buy a case so that the power button is slightly more recessed and this has worked in reducing power button pushes though not entirely eliminated them.  The problem is that I really don't like having a case for a product like this, it increases its weight and thickness to the point where one handed operation is far less comfortable.  At least it's likely to look pristine for longer I suppose.So in conclusion, the Kindle is still a 5 star device for me (maybe 4 and a half) that offers great value (especially if you get it on a deal) but curse you product testers for not putting the power button somewhere sensible!\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"21 March 2019","ReviewerName":"bitengineer","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Best Kindle I've had!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This is my 3rd kindle.  There are a number of small improvements Amazon have introduced compared to my previous devices.  Both my previous Kindle(s) died from drowning - or possibly from my efforts to resurrect them.  Alright, so I shouldn't read in the bath but I'm 71 and be damned if I'm going to change the habits of a lifetime -even at the risk of damaging a Kindle. The new one was more expensive than either of my old ones at £200 (I see that it is now £219 ). I could have got the cheaper \"with offers\" variant but I didn't like the sound of this and decided it was  worth paying the extra £40 or £50 - I can't recall the exact amount to have it \"without offers\". The new one has several nice features. The most compelling new feature for me was that it conforms to IP8 - ie its waterproof and can survive the odd immersion!  The higher resolution was another attractive feature, as was the larger memory and huge battery capacity.  The bluetooth connectivity seemed interesting but I have yet to try it out - I've never been a fan of audio books.  My previous Kindle's have all had WiFi + 3G connectivity and I wanted to have the same functionality.Of course, the new Kindle's use of 4G should provide faster downloading of books than 3G but that was fast.  All I  can honestly say is that I have not noticed any startling difference.This kindle seems to be more responsive to my scrolling and page turning gesturing than either of the previous models I had and overall, after several weeks of use I am pretty pleased with the new toy.The only criticism I have is that the button on the bottom would have been better placed at the top - I find it too easy to operate unintentionally  either by my hand or resting the kindle on a flat surface.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"27 February 2019","ReviewerName":"Z","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Terrible, disappointing customer service\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It has been a week and a half.

It was \"easier\" to delete the old Collections folders and create new Collections folders. Downloading and Transferring my few hundred books took an eternity and I seriously came close to returning the Paperwhite.

It's still working well about 6 years later. I felt like a change, I don't know why.So I went for the still cheap touch screen version. It really was little improvement on my old one. The touch screen was the only real change and no more convienent than the button pushing.However within hours it developed a flicker for no reason.So I sent it back for refund. I then had a mad moment and replaced it with the paperwhite.So within about 2 weeks I've gone through most of the Kindle developments.Well, I'm not very impressed.  Firstly the software developers obviously haven't had to work very hard during that time. There's so much of the original passing through to the latest.Firstly the home screen and library functions were always weird back then, they are certainly no better now. It's a mess.The page turnover rate is very poor considering the latest processors available now.The look and feel is nothing to write home about. As for it being waterproof, well if you want to read in a bath that's great!!And it certainly solves the long standing problem I've had of reading outside in the rain.It holds more books now.

This was reaching the point where school was starting to complain about his lack of reading.My wife and I have had Kindles, and had previously also bought one for an older relative on the basis of being able to increase the size of the text and therefore ease the eye strain.However it dawned on me to try with my son.  Most importantly I found that it has the OpenDyslexic font as an option, which works wonders for him. This, combined with the ability to set the size of the text and line spacing has revolutionised his experience to the point where the first night that he had this, he voluntarily chose to spend the evening reading and read two whole books !

Initially i thought I've just spent £100 for very little gain. The paperwhite is waterproof but I'm not likely to read it in the rain or in the pool, i don't read in the bath either. The touch screen is a modern step up but the side button page turning on the 4th gen was intuitive anyway as you held the sides and applied gentle pressure to turn. So i found myself asking, what have i got for a hundred pounds outlay? The answer is functionality. The page is definitely whiter, there is more control over brightness, inverting to white text on black page for reading at night. New fonts and more setting options. The touch screen is growing on me more as i use it though i still find myself squeezing the sides from time to time. Are the adverts annoying? No not really! I do prefer the old screensavers on my 4th gen but not enough for me to contact Amazon to have the adverts removed. There is sometimes a tiny delay with the touch screen when going to settings etc but hey, I'm reading so I'm supposed to be chilled and can wait a fraction of a second, not a problem to me.So overall I'm pleased and the flexibility and functionality is the thing that makes it easier to justify the cost to myself...i can now read at night which is a great step up from my old kindle.

The battery life is improved with an automatic sleep function, meaning that it takes a little longer for the kindle to come to life when opened ( I use a cover for mine so it still retains the feeling of opening a book.)

I have been keen on the idea of reading more but struggled with reading off my iPad as I just automatically went to Netflix or prime to watch shows and not to the books. But with this it’s completely seperate and I’m not tempted by other apps. It’s a really nice size small and light perfect for taking around with me in my bag and travelling but not too small that it’s difficult to read or get comfy holding.  I love the fact that it is waterproof as I can use it in the bath and when I go on holiday (my least favourite thing about books is when you go for a swim and then settle in to read and the books go all horrible and wet at the bottom). The battery life is amazing I’ve had it just over a month and the battery has only just died which is impressive when you think an iPad could only last you a day! Overall I think it’s great value if you are into reading already or would like to read more!  I did opt for a case and went with amazons own which was more money then others but I decided that the kindle wasn’t cheap so why not get a good case for it that will protect it and is also waterproof!!\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"20 November 2018","ReviewerName":"Kindle Customer","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love It\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love my new Kindle.My only complaint is why does it not come with a proper plug for charging???USB is ok but means you have to have computer on to charge :-(  I bought new Kindle so don't spend so much time on  internet, my last Kindle came with plug so maybe Amazon should rethink & include plug\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"23 October 2019","ReviewerName":"Candygirl","ProductRating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    There are problems, glitches and issues\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I was forced to buy a new kindle as my old kindle 4 stopped connecting to wifi. I chose the paperwhite as I read in bed and wanted the light. I didn't care about the waterproofing as I never read in the bath or swimming pool..The negatives are:I already owned over 500 kindle books, all,of which were arranged in collections or archived if they'd been read. The new kindle ignores all of this and all your books are lumped together. Half of the books I'd read were showing as unread so appeared in my unread books list. None of the collections had carried across so I had to spend quite a lot of time marking read books as read, creating collections and adding books to Short Stories, Non Fiction collections etc. This is tedious and unnecessary, why Amazon?Advancing a page when in a list or when viewing items in a collection, requires a sort of diagonal swipe movement, this often goes backwards or gets stuck and the same page loads over and over again. Is this just me?The time left in chapter seems quite random and not based on my actual reading speed. Is this just me?On my homepage, despite paying for 'without special offers' I have \"more books by xxxx\" which is a military history author who I've never read, sampled, browsed or shown any interest in at all. Why amazon, why?Frequently, when tapping to move on a page while you are reading a book results in a weird jump that moves on 3-4 pages or back 3-4 page and so you have to try and work out where you actually were in your book. Is this just me?I wish the progress bar was still visible, I wish there were actual buttons to change page and I wish the glitches above could be sorted.My existing charger only seems to charge the new paperwhite on one socket in my house, I'm hoping this is the charger and not yet another paperwhite glitch (my husband's old kindle is charging fine using the same charger and any socket in the house).The final negative is that less than 2 weeks after I bought my paperwhite it's come down in price by over £30, that's just annoying Amazon.The positives are that the light works really well, being bale to pick fonts etc is good. I'm not sure it's so much better than the new basic kindle to warrant the price though.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"6 November 2019","ReviewerName":"Millies Maid","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great item, couple of minor hiccups.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I deliberately bought this as I have a 7th generation one by my bedside and love it. I read a lot and no longer have to have heavy books so it is one item I would grab in a fire :).  It is easy to adjust the backlight, the text size etc and go to the store to choose a new book or search your own library for one you already have. So I am well and truly hooked on this tech to the extent I bought another 7th gen as a gift for a friend who reads.This is a 10th generation one, bought for downstairs, (I have poor health, stairs are difficult and I kept forgetting to carry the Kindle with me) and although everything else is great and the same as the previous one, there are a couple of really irritating hiccups. My original Paperwhite was bought in 2015 and I have only had to restart it once since then despite using it every day. The 10th gen one bought in 2018 - actually one year this month (November 19) and I first of all reported a problem with the charging life - less than a week whereas the other one was more like 2-3 weeks. I ran an experiment of my own and swapped them so that they got the same amount of usage for comparison. Also the charging was excruciatingly slow. I was advised to do a complete reset which I did and since then it charges fine.I have Prime membership and can borrow certain books from the library and obviously return some too.  But I have noticed that this 10th gen Kindle does not keep that information available to me without doing a restart, but the 7th gen does it fine. Whispernet is a bit temperamental too and I usually have to tell it to sync manually. These are, I admit, a minor inconveniences but is the reason I gave this just 4 stars overall.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"27 December 2019","ReviewerName":"Steps Ahead Fan","ProductRating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not as sophisticated as I'd thought\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I returned my Kindle Paperwhite for a refund and went for a Kindle Oasis instead.  I only got my Oasis today so it is too soon to comment on that but already I can see that it addresses the problems I felt i had with the Paperwhite, so here goes with what I didn't like about the Kindle Paperwhite;The screen size of the Paperwhite isn't that large - I'd say it's hardly bigger than the screen on my Samsung S7 Edge smartphone.....I did buy a Amazon Cover for it, the leather variety, and found that that made my Kindle Paperwhite quite heavy.  If you use the Paperwhite without a case I think you'll find the ergonomics of it (weightwise) to be okay.However, I wasn't too happy with the form of the Paperwhite - there are no contours to it, so you literally holding it through a fingertip grip (if that makes sense) which I found fatiguing.Personally, I found the tap-page-to-turn to be flaky, often it would take me to the previous page rather than the next page, and then tap once more which can also take me to the previous page (rather than the page forward) and I'd get lost.  Page tapping is the default way of moving through a book but I found swiping a page to be more reliable.Battery life seemed very poor - I was reading one book, a 225 pager, I don't have a large library at all (maybe 25 books if that) and no audiobooks and within 10 days of owning my Kindle Paperwhite it'd gone down to 32% battery life left.(bluetooth was switched off).Maybe I had a faulty Kindle, but so far, it seems my Oasis is a LOT better.  I'll write a review on that in good time (although I didn't buy the Oasis on Amazon as at the time they were out of stock).\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"8 January 2019","ReviewerName":"Gerard O&#39;Doherty","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Kindle Paperwhite\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Seems a bit highly priced for what you actually get.

Storage space is more than enough for the average reader to hold a high number of books in their collection.The soft backlight and crisp screen also provides for good reading along with sufficient settings to customise the reading experience.  This does not apply to PDF documents though which will be pretty much useless given the small form factor and having to slide the screen to read along the page.  Some people may find this disappointing.  As a workaround I had to convert the file format on the PC but even this has its limitations compared to native file formats.The biggest let down is the battery life.  Given the tech components used I would expect battery life to be excellent however I have found the battery to run down fairly quickly in a matter of days rather than weeks.  Given this common issue then I would have much preferred the  small kindle fire at least half the price of the Paperwhite.  It may be a little larger in form factor size but if the battery performance is no better than the paperwhite then basically I would be getting a colour screen with greater flexibility on apps, reading, social networking etc and there would be little difference.All in all the PaperWhite is a nice little piece of tech however buyers should consider benefits of getting a small tablet with more capability verses a PaperWhite whose only capability is focused on books, both with similar battery lives.  That is to say they both would need recharged every few days or thereabouts.  Once I get the use from the PaperWhite I would definitely replace it with a small tablet or ipad mini.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"1 August 2019","ReviewerName":"Gadgeteer1066","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Worthy successor to Kindle Gen 3 keyboard\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've had a Kindle forever. It's been a Gen 3 with a keyboard. It has sat encased in its leatherette case with its pop-out light and served me very well. Faultlessly, in fact. It's still as good as the day I bought it, but the light on the case was getting a bit flaky. I always thought I would miss the buttons on the side, how pressing a button seemed intuitively right for changing page. That's what held me back. The lack of buttons. the need to touch the screen.I have to say, having had my new Kindle Paperwhite for a few weeks now, I am impressed. I've adapted to not having the buttons and can manage perfectly well without them (should any of you out there be in the same boat). The backlight is impressive and unintrusive. It's just there when you need it and not, when you don't.I preferred the way my library appeared on my old Kindle (I'd set up categories and knew where everything was) and it was a little bit of a faff reorganising it for this. It's ok.Upgrading after so many years, I suppose I get to see all the improvements in one go, rather than incrementally if I'd progressed through all the iterations along the way. I like what Amazon has done. Menus are intuitive and easy to follow. No real downsides that make me regret my decision.Having had a case on my old one, I had to get one for this. AS much as I liked the light weight and size, I just felt I needed a case to make holding it feel more comfortable. It was the same with the original. I went for a Fintie case which was a similar style and look to my original. Now I am 100% happy.

I was very sceptical about how paperlike the screen could truly be, especially as part of my reasoning for not want one was another screen to give me a headache but the paperwhite is truly different and really does resemble paper. The lighting of thr screen is very subtle compared to the harshness of a smartphone light and even at low brightness levels its easy to read and works well in the sun too. It so easy to use and set up, a full charge lasts for ages and the multitude of personalisation options such as colour options, font and sizes, screen brightness, are simple to select. It is very light weight and thin, and comfy to hold too. Because it's so light and small I can pop it in my bag and take it everywhere with me.

But after heavy reading for a week had only used 25%.When holding in one hand (left) and put a finger under it to balance, it naturally tests where the power button is!

I was unsure about the change in screen from bright white to a more muted shade .however after reading a couple of pages I’ve adapted to it and am sure this will be fine.

I HATE touch screens, and have the same issue with Cretinphones.  You can't hold a Cretinphone without brushing the screen, and the expensive ones with bent edges are worst.  This kindle is marginally better than a Cretinphone because it at least has a small area to hold it by.But it's worst thing is the battery life, barely a week with very light reading, even with the backlight switch off.Edit:  I received a phone call from Amazon about this review.  The caller was helpful, but could only suggest turning off the WiFi to save the battery.  I contacted Chat support, and was guided through a Factory Reset.

I had to return the first unit as it was driving me up the wall with the touchscreen which had a mind of its own. The replacement Kindle is light, versatile and the touchscreen is easy to use and compares well with my other touchscreens. I have had it for about 24 hours and have read 9 chapters of my current book. This has included using VoiceView Screen Reader for a couple of chapters. This is a major step forward after the loss of my 10 year old Kindle with Keyboard which would read almost all my books in either a male or female digitised voice. I am so pleased to have this feature back even with limited controls and only a digitised female voice. It uses double tap commands and various swipe actions to control VoiceView so some learning time is required.I have found the body of the Kindle a little difficult to hold for a longer period of time due to the slippery feel of the case. I have solved this by buying the Infiland case which fits well, is easier to hold and shuts the Kindle down while closed. Also the case comes in a number of different colours and I chose the orange which makes it much easier for me to find where I have put the Kindle.The Invert Black & White feature is great for evening reading without disturbing my wife. It also helps with my partial vision. Text fonts, size and brightness are easy to control and I am happy with the range provided.Note that when trying to pair my Bluetooth headphones I had problems until I realised that my Samsung Galaxy Tablet was set on Bluetooth and nearby. As soon as I switched the Galaxy Tablet Bluetooth off the problem was solved.I hope this Kindle PaperWhite lasts as well as my old Kindle did.Update 19-10-2019. The PaperWhite is now my main reader. It is very easy to fit in a coat pocket and although the battery life is shorter than my old Kindle with keyboard I do not find this a problem to the extent that I have not found it necessary to record the duration of a charge.The PaperWhite has 2 snags for me: a) Being in black & white. This makes the pictures of book front covers very difficult for me to read and therefore a total waste of the limited screen space. b) I find the layout of my library and the grouping into genres very much hard to do than compared with my Kindle with keyboard.These problems do not warrant me reducing the rating from 5 Star.

Other than the lack of a light its great. I decided to finally upgrade in the prime day sale.  First impressions were good, it looks nice, its smaller than my old kindle and I like the non indented screen. Upon starting to use the device I noted that even with the light on low it really washes out the display and lessens the contrast. This leads to the contrast actually being lower than on my old kindle. Looking at both side by side with the paperwhites light off, they look the same, there has been no improvement in contrast in nearly a decade. It should be higher on the paperwhite to compensate for the effects of the light, but it isn't.While the contrast issue was disappointing its easy enough to get used too. My biggest gripe with the paperwhite is the battery. I knew going in that because of the light this wouldn't last as long as the old one did. However what I didn't expect is that with the wifi turned on this thing absolutely chews through the battery. Reading with the light on around 10 and the wifi turned on it dropped 2% of the battery in under 10 minutes. I left the wifi on all the time on the old kindle and it had barely any effect on the battery life.

This is my second as I had dropped the first whilst charging it and I suspect that the pins may have bent making charging hit or miss and very frustrating. I was lucky enough to receive this one as a present along with a leather cover. It is a pity that the dimensions of the latest ones are slightly smaller than the original meaning that my old cover does not fit. Initially all went well as I set up this new one, even a book ordered immediately after ordering the PW but before delivery was downloaded without me having to search for it. The set up was very easy and I was very pleased with it for the first days and then I noticed that another new book neither downloaded nor appeared in my library, it seemed that the PW was not updating. I used the restart function (I had never needed this on my old one) and the book did then appear in the library. When I purchased the next book it again did not appear automatically so I resorted to Amazon Kindle Support and after a while it seemed that the only remedy was to re-register the PW. That has worked and the downloads appear as normal so all is now well.Apart from this glitch I would have no hesitation in recommending the PW, because of the glitch I have docked it one star to four rather than the five it should have.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"17 November 2019","ReviewerName":"T1001","ProductRating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not impressed with the slow performance\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Very slow to respond and when screen refreshes it turns black for a second. Scrolling is a nightmare because the touch screen is so slow. Considering it’s sole purpose is books I find it difficult to navigate compared to the iPad app, I can’t just seem collections I have to figure out where they are. I had a fire before and that was much cheaper and did more. I only bought this as it’s waterproof and I thought it would be handy to keep all my study materials all in one place. With the adds and suggestions it’s more of a hindrance than a help, thinking of returning it. The price is not justified just for being waterproof, may as well buy the cheaper one because how often will we be at the beach really? First and last proper kindle. My 5 year old iPad is much faster for reading. This doesn’t even read pdf files and with no good way of converting a pdf I’ll have to use my iPad anyway.I’ve now found that I can’t search text because the book is ‘not indexed’. That makes it completely useless as a study tool. Not impressed with this device at all, except it’s a good size, easy to hold and I like the screen. Wish I hadn’t bought it, it’s certainly no upgrade. Performs terribly, it’s like it’s out of the 70s.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"5 June 2019","ReviewerName":"Amazon Customer","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Lovely piece of equipment when it works!!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought this as an upgrade to my voyage which had started to loose its battery life, the first one that arrived worked ok until an update and then it wouldnt download any of my book covers and wouldnt sync with my account, several chats with amazon and then a phone call and they decided it must be faulty and they sent me another, that one arrived last week and it downloaded all 800 books without any issues, then came the problems, it updated itself and once again no book covers would show nor would it sync with my account, if I purchased a book it just ended up lost in cyber space, if I sent myself a book via email no problems but buying from amazon and syncing was just not happening, another chat with amazon customer services and they said it was my wifi, it wasnt, my device wasnt connected on their end, it was, restart it, I have, deregister it, I did, reset it to factory settings, no way, been there done that!Eventually I was put through to a kindle tech who after the same old discussion decided to alter a few settings on their end and low and behold my books came through complete with covers and now they also auto download, they tell me I wont have any more issues now. Im keeping my fingers and toes crossed because never have I ever wanted to throw something across the room like I have with my new kindles!The battery drains like a bath when connected to wifi but seems to stablise when under normal usage.The text is a lot lighter than my voyage and sometimes is almost grey.The device itself is nice to hold and the button on the bottom although does get in my way sometimes doesnt switch itself off when caught.Overall I do love my kindle and I will continue to love it even more if it does the job it is meant to do and amazon dont keep updating and causing issues!\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"7 December 2018","ReviewerName":"Jake","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The Paperwhite is very slow\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This is my 5th Kindle.

Pity it didn't charge properly\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I'm a kindle devotee. This is my 5th. I still have my original Kindle keyboard (and it still works). My Kindle Fire 10\" is lovely but a bit big for just reading on. My 6th gen Kindle Paperwhite is delightful and still works, though I've had it for 5 years, now. I bought the 10th gen Kindle Paperwhite specifically because it allows white text on a black background, which is better for bedtime reading as the light doesn't disturb my husband, and for the bluetooth connection for listening to audiobooks. It's great for both those things. It's nice to hold (like my 6th gen version) and it does everything I want it to... So far, so good. BUT... there's a problem with the battery.  The device doesn't hold its charge well. After a couple of days of use it was down to 20% (worse than my old Paperwhite 6th edition). The device charged the first time. It didn't charge the second time until I plugged it in again. (Then it did charge to 99%). Today, after only a couple of days of reading maybe two hours a day, the battery was down again. I plugged it in when its battery was at 26%. After 4 hours of charging (charging symbol ON), the battery was down to 22%. I unplugged it and plugged it in again. Though the charging symbol was still ON, the device was down to 20% within 30 minutes. My old kindle paperwhite has a little telltale light next to the charger port which is yellow when charging and green when fully charged. This Paperwhite has what looks like a light in the same place, but if it is a light, it's never lit up at all. So I've sent it back for a refund. I expect Amazon will sort out my complaint. They're usually pretty good. I will order another one, of course, since I already have a new case for it and bluetooth headphones.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"14 August 2019","ReviewerName":"\n      \n        Rani\n      \n        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE\n    ","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    3.5 Stars\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    When I first bought this (December 2018) I had a horrific amount of issues, books wouldn't sync unless I totally reset (I did this more than a dozen times) and the battery depleted super fast, none of the advice the tech team gave me made much of a difference (and I contacted them multiple times) - so a replacement was sent out.The replacement kindle overall is working out well, although there are things that need to be improved in my view.Positive:- I love the fact I can carry hundreds and hundreds of books with me wherever I go.- the backlight is good and means I can read without the room light on when travelling and/or in bed.- The kindle is lovely and lightweight.- Big plus is that the kindle is waterproof (somewhat).Negative:- The battery life is horrific if you compare it to what is promised, especially if you have the Wi-Fi on.- It should come with a charging block and not just the charging cable.- I wish the way in which books were displayed was a tad different.- The page turning could be smoother.- The adverts/special offers were highly irritating and considering this was £119.99  when purchased I found it rather annoying that I had to fork out another £10 to remove them.- Unhappy about the fact that pre-ordering the device was £199.99 but then when it was finally released the price went down!- Unlike the first kindle I purchased there was no option to add  additional insurance.

In regular use, with the light minimised, the battery is much easier to manage and the screen is clear and easy on the eyes.  Swiping the touch screen rather than pressing a page-turn button is intuitive going forward but I still haven't quite got the hang of the going backwards technique!  On the plus side, being able to use the on-screen touch keyboard when buying books is vastly easier than the button pushing needed on my previous Kindle and, as a bonus, the new reader fitted my old cover.  I just wish the Collections system was more like the old software; I would greatly prefer collections to be listed in alphabetical order with any odd books not in collections appended afterward so that one could see easily which books are orphans.

Battery lasts ages and charges quickly.  Buying books from Amazon and delivery is the easiest thing ever.  And by far the best feature is the Kindle not only tells you how far you are into the book (as a percentage) but also the amount of time it will take YOU to read to the end.  Yes, I said YOU!  The Kindle knows how much is left in the book and based on how long you spend reading a page it works out how long it will take you to get to the end.  And it works.  So, if you are reading a thriller and really want to finish before you go to bed, it will tell you whether to push on or whether you'll still be sat there for longer than you thought.

I used to take old fashioned print books outside for reading in sunshine but I find ebooks so convenient that I really can’t be bothered with reading print novels anymore. They seem ridiculously heavy and awkward. It was actually stopping me from sitting outside or enjoying walking as much.Based on his recommendation I started looking for a secondhand or reconditioned  one, then I saw that this is watersafe and that was that - I was sold.

I have bought a cover but that exposes the sockets. I wish there were silicone socket covers like my old nokia clamshell phone. Perhaps they are available?My only real criticism is one that applies to all ebooks and readers. Why is the cataloguing of ebooks so terrible?. Now I have a couple of hundred ebooks i am getting increasingly frustrated by the terrible systems available. Yes I’ve tried Goodreads, and cloud collections. I’ve tried various apps as well. Why can’t I have the equivalent of shelves for my entire collection. I want to see spines, not lists or fronts,  and I want to move my books around with my finger tip just as I would with real books.

In regards to the extras you get with this new generation, they are a real bonus especially the audio. The Paperwhite is a very good e-reader and I see no point in getting the more expensive Kindle e-readers that are available.That said, I am having problems with my new generation Paperwhite. Considering the massive number of e-books I buy are downloaded to a Kindle Fire so the only book actually downloaded on the new Paperwhite is the one I'm reading at the moment the whole thing seems really slow. I know the new Paperwhite has greater storage (I chose 8GB) but I'm not sure if the processor and the RAM have stayed the same as the 6th generation which had an  ARM Cortex-A8 @ 800 MHz and 256MB RAM. I can't imagine they'd be inferior so I really don't know why this Paperwhite seems inferior to my previous model, which has quite a few books downloaded to it. The only thing I can think of is the improved resolution is slowing the whole thing down. I will give it another week and then get in touch with Amazon. It would be interesting to know if there is anybody else out there who has upgraded their Paperwhite and is finding the same problem.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"1 July 2019","ReviewerName":"\n      \n        Pixel Chick\n      \n        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE\n    ","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Rain Proof\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I give this 4 stars because the power button is located at the bottom of the kindle so I keep accidentally turning it off.

I find it a little more difficult to scroll through the library than I am used to but that will get better/easier with use.  There are 2 things that I wanted to point out.  The first one I find a bit frustrating, and that is the screen size, smallish in ratio to the device size.  As I am a little older and the eyes are going a bit I use the medium size text and find that there are not many words to a page and it seems that I'm endlessly turning pages.  I understand that it is likely to be designed like that to make holding a little easier but I think making it a little bigger would help.  The second thing is that I don't find it goes very bright.  It's fine at this time of the year when it is grey and darker than summer, but I do wonder what it would be like in direct sunlight during the warmer months.  We'll see I guess.  To sum up, I think it is probably worth the money to have this as a specific reading device and I have it on me most days.  Quick to turn on, not bad battery so that I don't get charge cable anxiety when I go away for a few days without it.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"27 July 2019","ReviewerName":"Dave","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    No negatives - it’s brilliant!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Have been using my dear old D01100 every day for perhaps 7 years, and loved it, but although still working perfectly, the battery life was beginning get very short between recharging.  My wife has had a Paperwhite for over a year now, and has been encouraging me to upgrade, which I reluctantly agreed to do, because it felt like a betrayal of a trusted and valued friend.  I dreaded the hassle of loading my library onto the new device, and wasn’t sure if I would like the backlight, (would it be a bit bright and glaring), and would the touchscreen be easy to use for someone with fat sausage fingers like mine?  I am delighted to report that this is, for me, the ultimate kindle - I love it, and it is such a joy to use that I am reading more than before.  The setup is much simpler than my dear old kindle, the backlight could probably give you a suntan when turned all the way up, but at around 10, it is absolutely perfect for me, and very subtle.  The display is beautifully crisp and pin sharp, and together with the subtle backlight, makes reading in low level ambient light, or at night, a pleasurable experience, without any hint of headache or eye strain.  It is MUCH easier to organise my kindle library, and my only regret is that it took me so long to make the change!\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"5 December 2019","ReviewerName":"P.

I loved that Kindle and wouldn't have switched except the battery started dying too quickly.  I was swayed by the fact that the Paperwhite is waterproof and also some people had told me that the backlight was convenient.  Having used it now for a couple weeks,  I so far have mixed feelings.  The backlight can be handy especially when I'm reading in the middle of the night, though I still prefer to use my old reading light.  But I'm less than thrilled with the touchscreen for turning the pages.  First off, I find swiping inconvenient.  I had tendonitis in my elbow and this action done repetitively can hurt.  Secondly, if I just tap, it's great if I'm sitting up or lying on my left side as the side of the Kindle to advance forward is easily accessible. But if I'm lying on my right side, and holding the Kindle with my left hand, then the side I need to tap to change the page is on the right and I have to move my left hand constantly to change the page. Furthermore, with the flat screen, I keep accidentally bumping the reading pane and changing pages when I don't want to.  If my hand slides slightly onto the reading pane or if I drop the Kindle the page changes.  I'm sure I'll get used to the touchscreen, but I really miss the old style buttons to manually turn the pages.  Seems to be available on the Oasis, but I don't like the extra size on the Oasis and the extra cost.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"20 October 2019","ReviewerName":"Ash1964","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have rediscovered reading.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have a much earlier version of a Kindle but didn't really use it, but I listen to Audible whilst in the car.I bought this as it has Audible so I can now carry on with the story when I get home without disturbing my husband watching TV, and it had a good score from Which?It's comfortable to hold and can be adjusted from portrait to landscape to suit your position.I don't notice the lit screen which is why I've given it 5 stars, you don't want to be aware of it - but I can read in any lighting condition.I saved money by getting the ad-supported version, I already know from Fire tablets that they aren't intrusive, only appearing on the sleep screen and when you wake the device up - you don't get ads interrupting your reading, if you are a purist then spend the extra money - but you don't need to.It's so easy to slip in my bag so that I can pull it out if I'm parked up or in a waiting room; much lighter than a book, you don't lose your place, and you don't end up with a creased/torn cover and curled pages (that last probably isn't important to most people but I'm slightly OCD).\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"28 January 2019","ReviewerName":"David Girling","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It Works !

During the course of using the messaging service, I agreed to allow a technician to contact me by phone.  At his request, I connected the Kindle to my Mac Book Pro and downloaded software to conduct the necessary repair.The technician took control of my Mac Book, I watched in horror as he acquainted himself with my operating history.  I immediately realized I was in the process of being scammed.  From that point onwards, I played along, only to be told that he had detected 11 faults with my IP address, each at a cost of £80 each to fix, requesting credit/debit card details to levy a charge of £880 for the fix.It was at that point he realized that he too was being played and discontinued the call.  On both occasions, my Kindles failed.  The GWR Wi-Fi was not working and could not be restored.In respect of the first Kindle to fail, I let the battery drain, recharged it and it came back to life.

The Paperwhite is grey in comparison. I consider the Voyage to be far and away the best e-reader in the world, which makes it all the more lamentable that it is unavailable. I like the text flush with the surrounding surface, which the new Paperwhite shares with the Voyage. The reason I can give the new Paperwhite only 4 stars is because the Voyage is so much whiter.

It is fairly simple to use with lots of settings, but now that I know it I really only use about 5 of the top features.  What I love about it is how light it is, how easy to turn pages, how simple to make the font larger (when my specs are in the car and i'm in bed!) and the brightness feature is a godsend.  Also the fact that you can still read it in full blaring sun is astonishing.  I was recently away for 14 days on holiday, read every day for a few hours and there is still 20% charge remaining.

Sometimes when you scroll back or forward a page or two, the device seems to lose it's way and you end up more than a few pages forward or backwards, and finding your original reading page takes some time.  Very frustrating.  2.  You cannot zoom in on photographs, for example I read lots of biographies which typically have photos with captions which are a very important part of the read.

The clarity of the print is much better on the Paperwhite.  It claims to be waterproof, which may well be useful in Cornwall, where I am moving to!  The lead for charging the device is much shorter than it was on my old Paperwhite.  So far, the screen appears to be responsive, possibly better than my old Paperwhite.

It's actually the second time that there has been a sale on this version of the Kindle (within about the last 6 to 8 months since launch). As such, I suspect that Amazon may offer a discount off this Kindle at least a couple of times a year. If you're price conscious like I am, then you may want to be just a little patient.In terms of performance, this All-new Kindle Paperwhite is a visible improvement on the one that I bought about three years ago. The new version has twice the memory, but that was never an issue for me - I had several hundred books downloaded on my old Kindle and it still had plenty of space for more. So that's not a major benefit for me.In my personal opinion, the major benefits of the All-new Kindle Paperwhite are:1) The text definitely looks sharper. There are more pixels per inch and this does make for smoother, rounder, more beautiful-looking text. It's not a major difference, but the words are slightly prettier to look at.2) Everything works just that little bit more quickly or smoothly. I think the page turns work more smoothly. And going into the dictionary or going from one feature to another seems to work more smoothly too.3) Having a waterproof Kindle is a major benefit, too. I was sometimes cautious about taking my old Kindle down to the poolside with me on holiday. Sometimes I would find reasons not to take it down with me for fear that someone in the family might knock it into a puddle or the pool or spill on it. But now I don't have to be so cautious!This All-new Kindle Paperwhite is supposed to be a few millimetres smaller than my old Kindle. However, the differences are negligible - I really could not have spotted the differences if I hadn't known about them.Overall, I'm very pleased.

The screen is much kinder on my eyes compared to tablets and smartphones. There is less glare on the screen compared to tablet screens (although not as much to not notice completely). I find the reading experience to vary depending on a few things however. There are some irritants.For one, I seem to be a bit clumsy with the touch screen page turning. It's not quite clear where the touch points are, and I wonder for a fraction of a second whether I've turned it foward or back if I touched the centre of the screen. It's also rather slow and the navigation isn't the most intuitive.Not all kindle books can actually be accessed on them (although it's fair to say most do). One of my Kindle store books come up with some message that it can't be opened on my Kindle Paperwhite (perhaps it's something to do with the formatting?). It was a guide book I think, so maybe it was that?On the subject of formatting and guide books, I found that some books don't translate well to e-books (more a fault of the publishers than everything else, but still irritating). Programming/Coding self teach books are some of the worse laid out books for kindle. Links do take me to Wikipedia which is nice. I find magnifying images not quite to my satisfaction, and wish it was a bit less cumbersome when the images are trying to display a grey scale picture with tiny details.It comes audible integrated which is excellent in regards to sound quality (Bluetooth, no speakers in device), and works with my Bose Quiet Comfortable 2 headphones very well. However I was very, very disappointed when it didn't appear to have the much hoped feature where it read aloud the audible books whilst highlighting the text. What's annoying is that the app on smartphones and tablets have this. That is a sadly missed feature and I find it relaxing to read that way on the apps. I really hope it is added in via firmware update.There is one problem that makes my blood boil. There is a power button on the bottom which is very poorly placed. I think it would be better on top than bottom. I lean it on my chest in bed sometimes when reading, which occasionally and accidentally turns the power off. That is by far the worse sin of this device and a very bad design choice in my opinion!I think for what it's worth I probably spent too much money on it for what is effectively is. With an advantage being mainly screen glare resistance and battery life, and quite a few negatives, I have to wonder if I can really recommend it to anyone who isn't a big book reader.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"7 February 2019","ReviewerName":"Anon","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    You can't use audible and read at the same time\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I had the early kindle with the experimental feature where it could read the text in a robotic voice....once I got used to it, I loved this feature because I could listen and read at the same time. I am dyslexic and although can read well, having the voice over is a real boon. So, when I saw this kindle had the audible function, I leapt to buy it. I go through audible books quickly but love having the text too (somehow I feel like I'm cheating if I just listen to a book) - and so was really disappointed to discover it's an either/or situation - you have to choose whether to read or to listen to audible. The Kindle does not have the immersive reading feature that the kindle fire does. There is also no sleep timer, so if I go to bed listening to a book, I have to set another timer to remind me to turn it off....or just use the audible feature on my phone, which kind of negates the need to have it on my kindle. I am so sorry to be bah humbug - it just doesn't meet my needs as I expected. The screen is great, the feel of the Kindle is lovely and it is easy to hold and navigate, but on reflection, I regret making the purchase.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"13 September 2019","ReviewerName":"The Cool Doc","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    New Kindle Old Problems!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Looks neat and feels light so fits in back better BUT, but for me too small for reading and too slim a rim.

What a great kindle it is, well worth the money, good to look at, good to hold. Battery seems to last a good long time when using it just for reading. I own the Oasis and as much as I love it I think this new paperwhite with blow the Oasis away. For anyone who just wants the kindle to read on, or listen to audio then this is the kindle you want. Don't waste extra money on the Oasis, as much I love mine I think I'd have had this if it had come out first. That said I only used the paperwhite over a few days, and spent to much time comparing and not reading.I also own the original Fire, the new Fire and kindle keyboard. The First fire and Keyboard are by far the best kindles I've owned. I miss that the newer ones don't have text to speech on them. when I'm due a new book in a series I used to enjoy listening to the last one I'd read to refresh myself. Although it could be a little robotic to start with, you soon got used to it. For me if they could do all the features of the Kindle Keyboard, with the added back light, an waterproof that would be MY all time kindle need.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"20 May 2019","ReviewerName":"littlegeordieman","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great, but not perfect\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Slightly smaller in size than my old 7th gen, which is good as it's easier to hold, but also means I had to buy a new case!

And lastly for the negatives, while the light is great for reading during the day, it doesn't go dark enough to read at night without keeping you (and your partner) awake. The lowest setting is about number 5 or 6 on the older Kindle.  Not sure why you'd need up to level 20 on the new one, seems a bit of a waste. There is an accessible option to invert the screen colours so you have a black screen with white writing, which kind of does the job (bar the odd brief flash of dull light when turning a page), but that means i never use the light as 90% of my reading is done in bed.Other than those, which are livable with, it's awesome! :) Couple of easy tweaks or software updates and it could be perfect.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"7 February 2019","ReviewerName":"Chas-Street","ProductRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Disappointed with the Battery Life\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've been using an iPad for 5 years to read my kindle books. My iPad generally runs for around 10 hours on a full charge, so I thought I'd treat myself to a Kindle -  I'm an avid reader and thought the battery would last significantly longer. Unfortunately the battery life is nothing like as good as advertised. I get around 48 hours reading from a full charge. So while the battery does last longer than my iPad, if you read a lot it won't last the equivalent of a week from a full charge. Also I turned it off completely for a few days and the charge still dropped from 94% to 86% without even being used. My advice - if you're going on holiday for more than 2 or 3 days always make sure you have  your charger & lead with you. Finally having read other reviews I do switch it to \"Airplane mode\" to conserve power while I'm reading, also I keep the backlight off when reading in daylight. So I'm rather disappointed with it's performance.The good points: it was quick and easy to download my book collection, the text is easy to read, and of course it's much smaller and lighter than my iPad to tote around.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"7 October 2019","ReviewerName":"Pete","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not as good as my older model\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Its not as good as my old one!I bought this because I lost a kindle, and couldn't replace like for like.It works well, seems ok.

It’s a great product, but in some ways I preferred the old model. I find the touch screen is liable to responding to minor adjustments of your grip by turning a page when you don’t want to, or by looking up a word for you or offering to make a note, and for some reason I often return to it to find the font size changed. The screen seems very cluttered for this reason.  I also found it easier when lying down reading in bed to click the page button on the side than it is to swipe the screen.I also found the grey frame less obvious that the paperwhite’s high contrast white surrounded by black. The brightness adjustment is useful and I suppose the choice of fonts might be helpful for some, I liked the low contrast and found it gentle on the eyes and much closer to reading a paper book, not like reading on a tablet.The waterproof aspect is reassuring though I didn’t find any problems with the old model and often read in the bath. The touch screen is much better for interacting with the kindle store, though I previously did all my ordering on a tablet so it wasn’t a problem. Sorting your books into categories is still a slow process especially doing it from scratch with 300+ books when I downloaded them to the new kindle, I may be missing a trick but had to read through the same list every time and still haven’t finished the job. I would have liked to see that improved.I also preferred the old model as I didn’t have to see “special offers” or be directed to the kindle store which feels invasive. I like to keep reading as a separate and calmer experience without the commercial side in my face. I might pay the money to have the “special offers” removed as I have had no interest in anything I’ve seen.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"1 September 2019","ReviewerName":"G Hill","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good model, great value and a definite improvement\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Purchased the latest version for my wife who has a 4th generation kindle.Impressed with the lighter weight and the benefits of the screen especially when reading in bed.Was very easy to set up and get started as well as transfer books from her old device.The waterproofing feature is really a bonus but you never know it’s usefulness as accidents can happen anytime and this feature offers a little more reassurance.

My only regret is that I didn't get one sooner! I love the fact that you can change the text size, great for late night reading when your eyes are getting tired.

I do find the moving of books from one category to another rather cumbersome, but perhaps when I get used to the new way of doing things it won't be so bad.  I just get rather tired of having to learn a new way to use the phone/computer/tablet/e-reader every year or so, just when I had got used to the previous set up.

The \"with special offers\" listing doesn't make it clear you get spammed with advertising and offers on the welcome page and your library page.  Switching it off immediately results in a £10 charge.  Nice one Amazon.  Secondly, it is slow to wake up.  When I opened my older paperwhite version, the last page I was reading of my book would almost immediately appear.  Now I have to look at a page that says \"waking up\" for around 10 seconds which is very annoying.  Far from impressed I'm afraid.

The only reason I knocked a star is because the kindle paperwhite has lost some features that were present in the original kindle keyboard, that I was previously using, such as the text-to-speech feature or a speaker (so audio books can only be heard using bluetooth headphones or speakers). If you are ready to part with these features, then this is the perfect device for you.

However I've noticed that it is quite sensitive to touch on the plastic on the right hand side. This results in the page turning as you read if you are holding the sides of the item and press a little on the right hand side.

It reads like a book there's no disputing that fact.Buy a magnetic case and it will also turn your Kindle on and off.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"16 August 2019","ReviewerName":"Sue","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good choice\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've upgraded from the old keyboard version so quite a change.I bought the one without offers which is what I wanted.I like that it is lit so you can read in the dark and can alter the brightness.It is waterproof so no more worries when on holiday by the pool.I was initially concerned about the battery life as it seemed to be draining faster than I expected, however this must have been due to me downloading all of my books because it has been great since.I've had it a few weeks and up to now can't find a fault. If I'm being picky, the touch screen isn't as quick as I'd like which is why I didn't give 5 stars.

If you have more than a dozen books, navigation is a nightmare. I have some 500+ books and browsing through them takes ages unless you know exactly what you need to search for. Home page is offensively non-customizable, internet browser is still in \"beta\", which is not a huge deal because, honestly, 99% of the time you wouldn't use it for internet access but still, for the 1% of the time you might need to (because you're outside and your phone battery is out or something) it IS a joke. The increased storage space is really not anything to shout about because the 500 books I have only take  up less than10 percent of the 8GB device!I am not returning it (gave it to my son) but being not a fanboy of anything, I think it would be fair to say this gadget in 2019 is not the wonderful technological breakthrough it's made out to be.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"2 January 2019","ReviewerName":"Kindleblorp","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great!

The audiobook feature is why I updated from the old kindle; being able to read books comfortably and listen to others in one simple dedicated device is brilliant.My only complaints?There is no timer function for audiobooks. So if you fall asleep the book will just continue forever and you wake up at the end - they need to add a timer option so it will shut off after so x-number of minutes, or at the end of the chapter, like on the audible app.Generic screensaver, still. When the kindle is off it should perhaps display your book cover, or at least that should be an option, as it is on other readers, or let us pick a nice picture? I'm really bored of the screensaver pictures that have been on Kindle since forever.Minor niggles that could be fixed with software updates and would garner a 5 star rating.

For years.A friend let me borrow his old Kindle and I was sold. The thing about the light is really important. Yes, you can read on an iPad. iBooks works. No problems there. But reading alot, and for a long time, the lights does matter. And nothing is better than the Kindle when it comes to that good, long reading session.Then, Kindle PaperWhite:This is my first Kindle.

I have not tried reading under water, but I have been reading every way possible for three days now, still 47% battery from 54% when delivered.I have big hands and it falls in place perfectly. There is nothing wrong with this. It is all good.I found my favourite J. London (John Barleycorn) and complete short stories by John Steinbeck in the amazon store for $80. I have downloaded a lot of free samples to read for later.I open it up (I bought a Omoton case https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07KG8HYCL/ref=pe_1572281_66412651_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp ) and have problems putting it down.

I can adjust the size of the text to suit me and like to know the percentage of the book that I have read along with how long in minutes it will take to finish a chapter. This suits her need to know how long I will be. I never lose my place and this year I am aiming to read 2 books while I am away...let’s see how that goes. The only downside is that the music tech synth book I have taken with me is in paper format which makes it less attractive to read. I love the small format a lot.

Amazon haven’t really sorted out the “collections” option, where you section the books - they don’t seem to work consistently across devices, but that’s more of an infrastructure issue, rather than a problem with this device, and it doesn’t effect access to the books.

And if you're just using it for reading then it lasts for ages.I use it with the light set really low - around 3 or 4 on the scale. It's plenty bright enough in the dark, and the light isn't necessary when it's not dark around, so I'm not sure why they recommend the brighter settings.Kid mode (parental control) is handy if you're not bothered about the audiobooks - you can set up a child's profile and choose which books in your library they can access.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"17 December 2019","ReviewerName":"Mr. William Mckain","ProductRating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    With special offer ???

Press on them and then report the error) the people who set the text will eventually get the message that these things need to be proof read.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"30 December 2018","ReviewerName":"Derek O","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Read in the dark, or in bright sunlight!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This my 4th Kindle (6th in the family) and I would be lost without it. My previous Kindle Paperwhite lasted for 5 years before it started developing faults, which could not be repaired. The storage is fantastic, ideal for holidays, you don’t have to carry your weight in books if you are an avid reader like me. I haven’t had occasion to check the claim that it is waterproof, and probably never will. The main advantages of the Paperwhite are, 1) the ability to read it in bed, 2) easily held in one hand, 3) page turning by touching the screen, 4) no need to have a light on which could disturb anyone else. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because there was s fault on one of the functions which took a few weeks to resolve, it is now working exactly as it should and I am hoping that this one (10th generation) lasts as long as my previous Kindle (6th generation).\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"29 August 2019","ReviewerName":"LUCY P.","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Amazing for a 1st time user!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Truthfully, I was almost put off by some of the negative reviews but I can honestly say - I'm so glad I wasn't.

By a mile. It's sleek, it's easy to hold for long periods of time, the five LED lights make it super easy to change the lighting to suit your eyes and the import of my library was quick and efficient. Although I will note that I have a very small library so I couldn't comment on the import of a larger volume of books.Overall, if you're thinking about making the switch, this is the model I would say to go for. The waterproofing features give you a wider range of reading opportunities and it is just a pleasure to hold and read on.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"27 January 2019","ReviewerName":"Bill K","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A good device, but take the adverts about its water resistance with a pinch of salt.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Delivery was quick and trouble free (I used Amazon Locker). The dictionary works differently from my previous Kindle (a 4th generation with scroll buttons). I remember that it took a long time to get comfortable with that one, so I guess I'll get used to this one. I use my Kindle mainly for reading French books and the dictionary is very important to me. The translation feature is a nice enhancement, but it's annoying that it keeps forgetting what languages I'm using.It now supports Dutch dictionaries properly, which is a great improvement.The one criticism is that it is not as waterproof as the advertisements lead you to believe. Far from reading in the pool or on the beach as the pictures show, the instructions that actually come with the Kindle say that it can withstand brief accidental dips in fresh water and that it should be kept away from salt or chlorinated water, and that if it is accidentally immersed, it should be switched off and stood on end to dry.  I feel that the adverts were somewhat misleading.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"10 October 2019","ReviewerName":"Don.

My old Kindle had a very good case with a built in flip out light but cannot compare to a backlight. I haven't made use of the waterproofing yet but look forward to reading in the bath! The only negative I have found is that the Special Offers are not compatible with an 'automatic' read/wake case as there is an additional step of awkwardly swiping the screen. As a result I had to pay the extra £10 to remove the ads but this is not enough to mark the product down.

Headphones connect via Bluetooth, so a whole entertainment experience in one small, very easily readable - even in the brightest sunlight - and adjustable package. It is also incredibly light and fits easily into a patch pocket or small shoulder bag. Oh, and right now it has 998 e-books and 31 audiobooks on it plus some PDFs, and I still have nearly 22 gb free!

The Paperwhite is poor in comparison because the touch-screen is nowhere near as good as the buttons. To turn the page forward you tap the right-hand side of the screen but sometimes it takes a light touch and other times it takes two or three harder touches. To go back a page you are supposed to touch the left-hand side of the screen but that just does not work. Rather you have to swipe from right to left.

But that would still work out more than I paid for the original so we're sticking with books. A real shame - I've only ever had positive experiences with Amazon in the past regarding product issues.

It's still going strong but looking a bit tired, and I have found myself moving back to paper books. With a holiday coming up, though, I wanted the convenience of a kindle... would the new (2018, 10th gen) Paperwhite be enough of an upgrade?Yes, and then some.While I understand many of the features it boasts that are new to me are not new to kindles in general, I am blown away by how sleek this thing is compared to my stone age gadget. The screen resolution is a thing to behold - no more jagged blocky text, and the freedom to use more delicate fonts (begone, hideous Caecilia).Ah, the fonts. One of the real selling points of this device for me was that Amazon have now made it easy to add custom fonts from a computer. I love this, as I'm not a fan of the standard fonts (Bookerly, which my old kindle didn't have, is rather nice though). As soon as I got it I added 10 serif fonts I liked, to make pages look more like those of an actual book. Even better, you can tweak the boldness to make it look just right.Everything is orders of magnitude more responsive than my old kindle. Navigating the store is no longer a trial. The frontlight is totally even. And I love the bezel being flush to the screen.Any downsides? It's a dust and fingerprint magnet. I still wish it had page turn buttons, but now Amazon force you to buy an Oasis if you want those. A colour e-Ink screen would be great but they're still a ways off.As for battery life... I've had it a month, have read 3 books, and it's still on its first charge, with 42% battery left.

I tend to use my kindle mainly on holidays 3 or 4 times a year & with my old kindle I never had to charge it while away. With my new one I tried it a bit to get used to it & thought the battery life did not seem very good. Two days before going away for a week I charged it over night then never checked it until the night before we left & the battery had dropped to 40% which I thought odd so charged it again. Twelve hours later after arriving at the airport  it had dropped to 19% ! I was not happy as I had a 5 hour flight with hardly any time left to read. While away I had to charge it twice & had only read half abook & listened to half a book. I made sure it was fully charged the morning we left & 5 hours later on the plane I switched it on to find weirdly it was 19% again!! I went back to John Lewis & explained the problem I was having & they exchanged it for me.I am now much happier & after trying different ways have found having the light off & in aeroplane mode I am just starting my 5th book with 40% battery still remaining. Obviously having the light on uses more as does using audible. I did try finding out about the battery in the guide on the kindle but it wasn't any help. Perhaps a few basic instructions as well as a book would help new users.In conclusion,  a bit of a shaky start but feeling much better with this one. On the whole though I am pleased with my kindle. My only worry now is what happens next time I go to the airport!

I haven’t though as my old kindle was so much easier, quicker and better to navigate.

On my new kindle all my books are there individually and I have to trawl through several hundred to try and find what I haven’t read or want to read. This is time consuming and extremely irritating especially when scrolling up I keep opening books I don’t want to and have to keep going back. It was a much simpler and quicker system (seconds rather than several frustrating minutes) on the old kindle and far less stressful.

However not enough shelf space made me start to wonder if a Kindle would be a good idea as I am always buying more books. I looked at the Kobo Aura H20 and was very tempted to get that as I liked the sound of the comfort light pro, a feature which is supposed to make it easier on your eyes and you can change the brightness and colour of the screen manually or the Kobo changes gradually to the time of day. I also liked that the back of the Kobo had a textured surface to provide better grip. I was slightly bothered by reviews of the Kindle which said the power button on the bottom was an issue and was easy to turn off accidently. In the end I decided to go with the Kindle as some of the books I want were only available on Kindle and I was told by several people that changing Kindle books to other formats is a pain. I received the Kindle as a gift for Christmas and I have to say I love it. I had an issue at first of the charging cable not seeming to fit, it took several attempts and I was about to give up when it eventually went in, perhaps some of them are just a bit tight when new, it has been fine since then. I have used it every day and the power button is no problem. The light is great for reading at night. I have the version with adverts but paid today to remove them, the adverts weren't a big issue for me but better without. The battery charge won't last me weeks as I have been using it more than the time Kindle/Amazon base their best battery life on, that doesn't bother me as so far it seems to last about a week which is fine by me. The Kindle won't replace physical books for me but it does make an excellent edition. The only thing I would change would be to add the same comfort light pro feature as the Kobo Aura H20, overall I am very happy and would recommend.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"1 June 2019","ReviewerName":"Lee W","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The best gadget I never knew I needed!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Firstly let me start by saying I have never been one for reading very much.

I however, read technical books, magazines and standalone articles. Getting things onto the Kindle is easy, you just connect the USB cable to the laptop and it appears as a shared drive.  You can then drag and drop things into the appropriate folder on the Kindle. The problems appear when you try to read it. Some magazines I read are available in MOBI format which the Kindle likes and has a Table of Contents but even here it is not easy to keep switching back to the contents to read articles in a random order.  The other problem is the handling of graphics.  We are used to using two fingers to expand/contract and move around a picture on our phones. The kindle is not quite there yet. The final problem comes with documents that are only available as PDF files. The Kindle displays a complete (A4) page on each screen which is too small for my (old) eyes. With lots of taps, you can change from portrait to landscape mode which does help things a lot but again it would be nice to expand/contact the screen with simple swipes especially where graphics are involved.  Also, the portrait/landscape setting is not set for individual books so if you are reading several books you have to keep swapping between the two. Overall conclusion, read novels on the Paperwhite, non-fiction/reference books/magazines on a Kindle app on your tablet or phone.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"26 January 2019","ReviewerName":"Adam Ogle","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Perfect travel companion for those who love to read\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've been deliberating about buying a kindle for a while as I love reading but I like the feel of an actual book but travelling more often pushed my hand!

Put it on the top or make it a toggle switch like on a kobo. Other than that the device works great.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"2 September 2019","ReviewerName":"Josephine Senior","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Lightweight, neat design.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    My Granddaughter bought me this to replace my original kindle paper white.I loved my original one but for some reason I cannot work out, I cannot download any new books onto it ?.My new one is lighter in weight, therefore easier to hold.But, for some reason I preferred the format of my old one.When I closed the case, it switched off, when I opened it, it switched on.I have to manually switch my new one on and off !I found my old one easier to navigate around too.However, I hope with useage,I will come to love this one as much as I did my old one !\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"13 December 2019","ReviewerName":"Worthers UK","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Kindle Paperwhite Cover\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Recommend this Kindle Cover - it’s lightweight, well constructed and protects the Kindle just as described in the advertising blurb.

The only slightly off-putting feature is that it tells me how many other people have highlighted certain passages in whatever book I am reading.

Unfortunately, I find that the touch screen is way too sensitive and you only need brush it with a finger and it changes page.  However, the border surrounding the screen seems to be much smaller than my older kindle which means I end up inadvertently touching the screen way too often.Lastly, due to the March of technology for things to be smaller and lighter, this newer kindle lacks any weight to it, much lighter than my older Kindle.  When holding it it’s almost as if there is nothing in your hand.

I came up with some solutions you might like to try solve the identified issues.1. When reading and holding the Kindle it is too easy to touch the protruding On/Off button  and switch it off- Solution:  is to change the orientation from portrait to landscape. The button is not easily accidentally pressed when reading in this format.2. Getting rid of the adverts - Solution: when you finish reading and want to switch off, hold the On/Off button down until a sub screen of options appears, go to ‘SCREEN OFF’ the bottom option and press that until the screen does go off. Close your case, if you have one, if not just leave it showing the blank screen. Then when you want to read again open the lid of your case and the Kindle will go direct to the page you left without the advert popping up.3. Battery Life. I also think when using actions in 2 above there is some improvement in the battery performance.Good LuckTony\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"31 July 2019","ReviewerName":"CatW","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A great update if you love Audible!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've had an older kindle paperwhite for years and it is still going strong, so I hadn't contemplated changing it until I saw this edition included audible.I love audible books and was previously listening on my smartphone in the app. However, having both the book and the audible copy downloaded on the new kindle means that they sync with each other whenever I need to swap to headphones and back so I never lose my position.

I’d been speaking to a friend about how I liked to read etc but sometimes when going away I had to decide which books to take with me as too many took up too much weight & room. He recommended a kindle.I was unsure. I like the feel of a book & silly as it sounds, the smell! I like to hold a book and know I’m reading it.I took the plunge on prime day to follow his recommendation.First thought, crikey that’s light!Charged it up, powered on & signed into my amazon.First thing that I really noticed was the screen flicker when I swiped on the screen. It felt like I was using a really old tablet which didn’t have the memory capacity to keep up with me swiping. I now understand I was wrongly comparing it to the use of a tablet when this is what it is, a portable book reader & storage.Signed up to free trial of kindle unlimited and started reading. Since then I haven’t really put it down. I’d say I’m reading more than I was before and it’s so easy on the eyes when reading in bed without the light on.My initial reservations were guided by a false expectation after being used to swiping and reading stuff on my Samsung Tablet. This is a far better reading experience than trying to read a book through the kindle app on the tablet though.If you understand it’s use and what it’s for then you will come to enjoy using it. I am still within the period where I can send it back if I wish but I wouldn’t be without it now so it’s here to stay.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"6 December 2018","ReviewerName":"Peter","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great peice of kit\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Got this after my old kindle passed away earlier this year. The form quite nice, with the light and text being of the usual standard I've come to expect from Amazon's devices. Build quality is good, water resistance (let's not lie and say this is \"waterproof\" now Amazon - it's splashproof) seems to be up to scratch and response times are great.Niggles:Lack of buttons. I don't like that this is touchscreen. Getting to the home screen is a little fiddly, requiring you to press in just the right place on the screen. Page turns can be a bit of a faff if you're holding the item with your left hand. Maybe I'm just old school but I'm a firm believer that buttons beat touchscreen hands down for usability with EBooks. I'm not paying another £100 for them though - that's just ridiculous. Admittedly, the touchscreen does make it easier to type, but as I don't tend to buy through the Kindle or search very often, and tend to use the same wifi networks, this is a feature I very rarely use.Cases - realistically you're looking at laying out at least £30. Which is a shame - Had it been £10-20 I'dve not hesitated.--Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic product, but the lack of buttons annoys me enough for me to give it only 4 stars.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"16 June 2019","ReviewerName":"cjmp.41","ProductRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Kindle Paperwhite What a disappointment\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have purchased 7 versions of Kindle and decided to purchase the latest version as better battery life etc.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

I have installed the Kindle App on my iPhone and iPad as the Kindle syncs with both of them (as well as iMac at home) so I have the best of all worlds. The front light facility is really useful in poorly lit environments. I purchased it over two weeks ago and whilst I have used it regularly every day it still has 30% charge left.

Amazon sell Kindles without ads for an extra £10, so charge £10 if you upgrade a standard Kindle to a \"no ads\" version. However, if you switch a \"no ads\" Kindle to an ads version, Amazon does not refund you the extra £10. So it's heads they win, tails we lose. It would be fairer that anyone who decides that they want ads after all should have the extra £10 refunded IN THE INTERESTS OF FAIRNESS.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"17 March 2019","ReviewerName":"Mrs Livingstone","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A bit disappointed\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I loved my 6th generation Kindle PaperWhite which I bought in 2013 and I was told that the latest edition was much better and so I decided to purchase a brand new one.  It's great, but I'm disappointed because I can't detect any improvement. It's much slower 'waking up' than my old one and I honestly don't think the charge lasts any longer - in fact without doing a check I'd guess that it's not quite as good.  I'm giving it four stars because it's a Kindle and I love using one to read my favourite books but I don't think it's any better than my six year old one.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"23 April 2019","ReviewerName":"Mrs. V.

Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to my expectations and I wish I had spent the money on an Amazon fire tablet instead. The battery doesn't hold its charge as advertised, possibly because it keeps switching itself on. I frequently go to pick it up from where I left it switched off, to find it on and displaying one of the book advertisements. The longest I have managed without recharging is 48 hours. When it comes to switching it off 9 times out of 10 it flicks to an advert instead of giving me the option to switch off, so I have to swipe back in and try again. Simple enough but frustrating. I find the library list a bit cumbersome to use, there must be a slicker way to display the books. My biggest problem with it however, is that it doesn't display magazines properly, making them near impossible to read and enjoy. So, I end up having to take my old tablet out with me in case I want to read a magazine. Altogether a bit disappointing.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"4 February 2019","ReviewerName":"Mrs. Karen L.

When it jacked in I was faced with two choices, buy a a new battery and hope that was the problem or buy a new device.  I bought a kindle paperwhite and I have not regretted it.  I had the usual problems you get with any new device trying to navigate my way round it.  The screens and controls are completely different from my old on and after a fortnight I still haven't bottomed everything (What is the screen that comes up when you lift the bottom of a page?) but I am getting used to the rest of it.  So, pluses and minuses.  Oddly enough I find the touch screen a minus.  I like to read in landscape mode, not portrait and with my old device I could hold it in one hand and flick the page using the mechanical buttons on the side.  On the touch screen I need one hand to hold and one hand to flip.  I still find the logic difficult to follow and for me the screens are not intuitive. The pluses are the obvious ones: it holds a larger library, the illuminated screen makes for less eye-strain and the layout of the library is better.  All in all I am pleased with my purchase and if I had to replace it I would buy another,\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"7 April 2019","ReviewerName":"Amazon Customer","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Changed how I read books\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    So I’ve resisted converting to kindle for years...I like a book, that is unless it’s a hefty hardback I need to carry or try and read in bed, or I’m packing 3 or 4 books for a holiday.Benefits- You can highlight text and mark pages to go back to- Read at night without needing a light on- Tones of books in a small device that slots in a bag or airplane seat pocket- Download new books on WiFi- Try samples firstNiggles- navigation needs practice- couldn’t find any punctuation beyond a full stop when leaving a review- prompts you to write a reviewer the end but if not on WiFi tricky to find this prompt again\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"31 January 2019","ReviewerName":"Thomas J. costen","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    kindle slim and light\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    what a great deal leather case fast charger and then a waterproof, light weight paperwhite kindle, and I can now read in the dark with a adjustable light level back light, and I can now read in the bath, also I can now download audio tapes and listen via Bluetooth. no worries about transferring books from old kindle registered new one  and all dater from old kindle transferred. no edges just a smooth flat screen and surround, can find no fault except I read more instead of doing washing up.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"19 September 2019","ReviewerName":"LD","ProductRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Glad I repurchased newer model!\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love it! I previously had an old model who’s battery started dying too quickly so gave in and bought a new one. It’s definitely improved, a bit smaller (so old case didn’t fit) but feels lighter and I love the smooth front. With the older model bits of dirt would get caught between the edge of screen and frame so none of that now. I have the version with ads, doesn’t bother me at all, when I’m not using it I’m not looking at it! That’s the only time they’re there, when my case is closed. And the battery is great, I read for at least an hour most days, it’s going down roughly 20% per week. That’s with backlight off as I only really read during the day. All round, definitely glad I repurchased!Update - 7 weeks exactly since received and 1st 100% charged, not charged once since, still reading pretty much every day, now often with backlight on when inside due to the weather, it’s at 15% charge. DLd several books too if that makes a diff, otherwise always on aeroplane mode. Couldn’t be more impressed with the battery and performance!! Well done Amazon! I’m going to keep going to almost zero then charge it. I’ve read batteries have a sort of ‘capacity memory’ so best to let them drain fully rather than always topping to 100.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"17 August 2019","ReviewerName":"Tracy","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Happy with it\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I had a few problems when I first got this new device and had to have help from Amazon a couple of times.

If I had a choice I wouldn't have given it up for a couple of good reasons. For one I don't want a cover so the slide on off button was a winner, just pulled my replacement out of my bag to find the battery is flat and I am guessing its because the on button which is very easy to engage has been pressed keeping the kindle on. Another is I am left handed, so having to hold with my right hand so I can turn the page is disappointing. The push buttons on either side of the keyboard meant it didn't matter what hand you held the reader with you could go forward or backwards as you wished without swapping hands. The good points is the display is crisp. Struggling to get used to the new layout and why it returns back to main screen instead of the book list, and why you have to guess which part of the screen to press to return. However it is smaller and it is lighter and I clearly still missing my keyboard.  So if I was to change this,I  would be to bring the side buttons back and a home button which stays visible. Would also make the power button a bit more travel friendly.\n  \n"},{"Id":0,"ReviewDate":"12 November 2019","ReviewerName":"Brenda Richardson","ProductRating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","ReviewTitle":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Customer service staffs knowledge disappointing.\n  \n","ReviewText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    So far I am happy with my Paper-white Kindle.
